comedy "['A documentary about the final year of foreign policy during the Obama administration, and incidentally about the grim surprises that life sometimes has in store…', '""The Ballad of Narayama"" is a Japanese film of great beauty and elegant artifice, telling a story of startling cruelty. What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'It’s hard to say whether “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” about a group of teenagers who turn into videogame characters, is a sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams hit “Jumanji,” a remake, a reboot, or something else. But it’s definitely the kind of movie that works the name of a classic rock song into its title and makes sure to blast it during the end credits, so that people who were in their twenties during the 1990s and now have kids of their own (and probably took them to this film) can feel that Pavlovian tingle.\xa0', 'That description makes the new “Jumanji” sound like a cash-grab, and in lot of ways it is—studios are so enamored with the notion that pre-existing intellectual properties are box office insurance that they’re far more likely to greenlight this than something genuinely new, even though exactly no one has spent the last two decades saying, “I wish somebody would make another ‘Jumanji.’” At the same time, though, this is a\xa0likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that. It has enough twists and surprises to pull viewers along, despite the fact that writer-director Jake Kasdan’s story (co-written with four people) is ultimately not much meatier than the one from a 1990s videogame that the characters end up inhabiting after getting sentenced to a “Breakfast Club”-type detention at school. (In the original film, the titular diversion is an old-fashioned board game, just like in the source material, Chris van Allsburg’s popular children’s book.)', 'The protagonists here are\xa0Spencer (Alex Wolff), an earnest nerd; Spencer’s onetime best friend Fridge (Ser’Darius Blain), a football star who ends up grounded after authorities realize Alex wrote a homework assignment for him; Bethany (Madison Iseman), a classic snotty Heather-type who’s addicted to her smartphone and takes selfies constantly; and the bookish, socially anxious Martha (Morgan Turner). They all have insecurities and issues. Once they end up inside the Jumanji videogame, these same characters are played by Dwayne Johnson (as Spencer the nerd); Kevin Hart (as Fridge the jock); Karen Gillan (as the super-fit avatar of Martha), and Jack Black, of all people, as Bethany. There are supposed to be five characters in the game-space, though, and we meet the fifth in due time: Alex Vreeke (Nick Jonas), who is introduced as an energetic teenager in the film’s 1996 prologue, only to get sucked into the game and become The Local Missing Boy whose endlessly grieving family still lives in their now-decrepit house.\xa0', 'The body-switching gag threatens to wear out its welcome quickly (hah ha, the scrawny nerd looks like Dwayne Johnson now, and the awkward girl has washboard abs!), but the actors take their assignments to play teenagers so seriously that the film surfs along on a wave of poker-faced earnestness, mixing moments of pathos in with its super-broad slapstick. (Except for Dan Castellaneta’s Homer Simpson, nobody screams in pain more hilariously than Kevin Hart.) At certain points you might feel as though you’re watching the longest, most lavishly produced “Saturday\xa0Night Live” sketch ever, complete with lush jungle scenery (the film was shot partly on location in Hawaii) and attacks by CGI hippos, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and the like.\xa0But since the entire thing plays like a 10-year old’s Disney Channel fantasy of what adolescence will be like, it works well enough, especially when coupled with intense discussions of the game’s rules (how many lives you get, how many levels there are, how to lift the curse from the land, etc).\xa0', ""Both the videogame’s construction and its gender politics are very ‘90s. The movie is aware of this and makes fun of it, though there’s a bit of an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too aspect to the way it puts Johnson and Gillan's bodies on display. There are occasional jolts of mayhem, thanks mainly to the motorcycle-riding ninjas who do the bidding of the movie’s villain John Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), a demonic figure who wants to control the Jaguar’s Eye and claim dominion over the land. The action scenes are constructed with a bit of panache and manage to be exciting though you’re never seriously worried that any major character is going to lose all of their lives. Kasdan, a veteran filmmaker who happens to be the son of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “The Empire Strikes Back” screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, has an old-school sense of how to build those kinds of sequences. The shots are thoughtfully composed, for the most part, and you always know where you are and what's at stake from moment to moment."", 'The script’s scenarios allow for charming, often faintly surreal funny character moments, as when Black’s round yet flouncy Bethany instructs Gillan’s super-fit but still physically awkward Martha on how to be sexy. Black’s ""hey, sailor"" walk evokes Bugs Bunny in drag, and Gillan’s subsequent “seductive” dance to distract some guards looks as if she’s trying to shake sand out of her shorts while simultaneously dealing with a bad case of swimmer’s ear. The film doesn’t have the nerve to follow some of its more subversive ideas (such as Bethany lusting after Alex) to their logical conclusions, probably because this is an expensive project that’s terrified of alienating a certain sector of the public (imagine the walkouts if Jack Black lip-locked with Nick Jonas in something other than a CPR situation). But it’s still more surprising in more ways than it had to be, and the performers are clearly having such fun playing insecure teenagers that you stay involved even when the thinness of the enterprise becomes undeniable. This is a two-and-a-half star movie, honestly, bumped up a notch because the actors are likable, the film doesn’t have a cruel thought in its head, and the sentimental finale feels earned.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

comedy "['There have been some memorable characters to come out of Chicago\'s South Side Irish community. Published in the 1930s, James T. Farrell\'s Studs Lonigan—a trilogy on the life and death of the archetypal blue-collar South Sider—remains a timeless testament to an area as colorful and storied as any big-city ethnic enclave. And in 1971, Mike Royko put out Boss, an incendiary character study on another South Sider of mythic proportions—Chicago\'s Mayor Richard J. Daley. So who are the South Side Irish? They\'re a proud, tough-as-nails bunch. Generally speaking, they\'re also rowdy and know how to knock back more than just ""a couple two-tree beers,"" as the vernacular goes in the Windy City. And they\'re notorious chiselers.Adding to the area\'s lore are the Gallaghers—the foul-mouthed, hard-drinking clan on Showtime\'s ""Shameless,"" possibly the most functionally dysfunctional family ever to grace prime-time TV. It all starts with William H. Macy as Frank, the Gallaghers’ single-parent anti-father figure. When Frank\'s not at the only bar in the neighborhood he isn\'t banned from, he\'s probably sleeping off his hangover under the ""L"" tracks. Macy is pitch-perfect as the unshaven, puppy-dog-faced Frank, and he\'s the show\'s driving comedic force. He\'s just as much the silver-tongued barroom bard as he is a hapless, pathetic wastoid. He\'s right at the heart of the show’s irreverent, boozy chaos.“Shameless"" might as well be called ""It\'s Always Sunny in Chicago."" But then there are the tender moments, the scenes that explore the emotional complexity of a wild but resilient family, living in a bruised but not broken home. On the other hand, Frank\'s eldest of the six Gallagher kids, Fiona, is the family\'s glue. Emmy Rossum brings gravity to the storyline as the motherly big sister who packs the lunches and pays the bills, but still manages to contribute her own fair share of vice.The balance between the two leads is what makes the show somewhat of a categorical anomaly. If Fiona wasn\'t around, ""Shameless"" might as well be called ""It\'s Always Sunny in Chicago."" It has all the absurd, mean-spirited and liquor-driven humor that fans of Danny DeVito’s show love. But then there are the tender moments, the scenes that explore the emotional complexity of a wild but resilient family, living in a bruised but not broken home. The supporting cast is also strong. Joan Cusack uses her duck-lips-in-a-washing-machine facial quirks to perfection here. The longtime Chicago resident plays Sheila Jackson, a married, agoraphobic nympho who Frank shacks up with. Sheila dotes on Frank with bathrobes and Belgian crepes. In return, Frank gets handcuffed to the bed and sodomized by large, bowleg-inducing objects. It\'s a mutually beneficial relationship, and one just as typical as any in ""Shameless.""While the Chicago flair is mostly spot-on, the show\'s origins are foreign. Like ""The Office,"" ""Shameless"" is a remake of a British series.

comedy "['With a title like The End of the F***king World, you’ll quickly realize whether this extremely dark comedy is for you. After all, the opening line is “I’m James. I’m 17. And I’m pretty sure I’m a psychopath.”', 'This eight episode show follows James (Alex Lawther) and Alyssa (Jessica Barden), two damaged teenagers, as they run away from home to escape from their sad lives. James constantly has thoughts of murder while Alyssa hates pretty much everyone else in the world, except James. The storyline often switches perspectives between the two protagonists, giving viewers a deeper look into their psyche with voiceover narration. That stylistic decision helps you empathise with their struggles that would otherwise be completely unrelatable. It also doesn’t hurt that the pair have great chemistry.', 'While the tone of the show is quickly established, the plot takes a little while to gain traction. Despite a very short season, the action heats up only towards the back half. Without getting into spoilers, consider it a three episode pilot. Some of the middle installments are pure filler, which is surprising given the binge-friendliness of the show.', 'A major flaw is how The End of the F***ing World tries so hard to be edgy. The writing often feels like it’s trying to push boundaries just to get a reaction out of the audience. If the shocking were more organic, the tone would play better. It’s not much of a comedy either, even by dark standards. That being said, the show is still decent, providing a nice counterculture viewing option.', 'I saw the trailer yesterday and frankly, it did not make an impression. It feels too weird to me.

In addition to his coverage, our contributors report the latest from Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Sundance and other movie showcases world-wide.', 'The premieres continued on the first Friday of the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, including new films starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie, Steve Buscemi, Jason Sudeikis, Jessica Chastain, Jake Gyllenhaal, and many more. We’ll get to the boys later in another dispatch, but I had a chance to see the Ronan vehicle and Robbie’s transformative performance today, and can report on a pair of other “smaller” films that may not have gotten the same red-carpet attention.', 'Let’s start with the biggest surprise of TIFF 2017 so far, Craig Gillespie’s razor-sharp “I, Tonya,” the dark comedy approach to the story of Tonya Harding that you had no idea you needed as badly as you do. Writer Steven Rogers and the director of “Lars and the Real Girl” approach a story you think you know as if it’s the fourth season of “Fargo,” finding black veins of hilarity, absurdity, and violence in the story of ice skating’s most controversial figure. It would be an understatement to say that Gillespie’s film does not take the typical biopic approach. It is not an “explainer film”—one of those movies that tries to recast a controversial figure in a new light. It is something altogether strange and original, and it’s a film people are going to be talking about.', 'From the beginning, the tone of “I, Tonya” is unexpected because there was enough darkness in Tonya Harding’s life for an entirely different approach. As captured here—and the film make it clear in clever ways that truth is fluid and even the interviews used to make this film were contradictory—Harding had to fight her entire life. Her mother, played here with horrific perfection by Allison Janney, one of cinema’s best hurlers of profanity, was just awful. She chain-smoked, physically abused Tonya, and convinced herself that it was her pushing of her daughter that made her a star. As she says late in the film, her own mother did nothing and she still hated her. At least Tonya was a star athlete.', ""Harding went from one abusive relationship to another, ending up with the unforgettably mustachioed Jeff Gillooly, played with a dangerous blend of idiocy and rage by Sebastian Stan. This take on Gillooly is as one of those people who are so blandly stupid that violence just becomes a part of their life because they can't think of any other way to fix their problems. Jeff and Tonya would scream and fight and hit and sometimes shoot, and she took that anger and channeled it into something at which she was undeniably great, ice skating. Gillespie and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis do a phenomenal job of capturing the flow and excitement of the sport, but the whole film sparkles in terms of visual compositions with a camera that almost always feels like it’s moving, skating in and out of domestic scenes as well as ones on the ice, but never to a distracting degree."", ""The centerpiece of “I, Tonya,” and what people will really be talking about, is the stunning work from Robbie, the best of her career to date—yes, I know, she’s great in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” but this is challenging on a different level. Her take on Harding is much more than just a physical transformation—she presents Harding not as a tabloid subject or a sob story but a completely three-dimensional person, someone who knew the world was unfair at a very early age and had to fight against that at every turn. Robbie is alternately defiant and hysterical, but she never takes the easy way out, which would have been to turn this take on Tonya into a parody or a tragedy. She contains elements of both. She's alternately defiant and miserable. It's a physically and emotionally demanding performance, and Robbie doesn't take a single false step. She does something even most traditional biopics fail to do—she tells us her side of the story in a way that feels heartfelt and genuine. Everyone here is great—I didn’t even mention the always-fantastic Julianne Nicholson and Bobby Cannavale—but it’s Robbie’s movie. And she nails the triple axel. \xa0"", '“They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.” With this great opening line, Ian McEwan’s novella “On Chesil Beach” sets its stage perfectly. Set in 1962, this short but brilliant book examines a time of sexual repression, and how that was coming to an end, although perhaps not quite quickly enough for his protagonists, the newlyweds Florence and Edward. As played in the film adaptation by Dominic Cooke (written by McEwan), these two are uncommonly in love with one another but have never made love, and the typically beautiful consummation on their wedding night—well, let’s just say it doesn’t go as planned. ', 'The always-phenomenal Ronan plays Florence as a perfectionist but not in the cold, detached manner a lesser actress would have taken the material. The film version of Flo is more gregarious than I expected (I was a big fan of the book FYI), but the interpretation works. Even in the book, Florence is a woman who is stridently confident in the right situation, willing to defy her strict parents and date a boy of a lower class, and willing to go to meetings to Ban the Bomb. She’s just not interested in sex. A passage in the film, taken loyally from the book, in which she reads about something as disturbing as penetration is fantastically captured. ', 'While Ronan is predictably strong, the breakthrough here is “Dunkirk”’s Billy Howle as Edward. Howle’s performance will rank with the best of TIFF. He perfectly captures the blend of naivete and confidence within this young man, one who recognizes that he’s on the cusp of a cultural revolution, and just happens to still be in a time when men have to get married if they want to get laid. Howle deeply understands this character—his relationship to his brain-damaged mother, his unabashed romanticism and love for Florence, and his eventual, life-changing anger. ', 'What holds back “On Chesil Beach” from the greatness of the book is relatively predictable in that the source is practically a short story and much of it takes place in flashback/memory. In the book, McEwan can telegraph the sense that we aren’t really leaving this pair on their wedding night as much as filling in the gaps in a way that makes the baggage they bring to their bed clearer. The film, on the other hand, feels more traditional in that we are always leaving the beach, going through long scenes about their courtship and learning about their characters in ways that feel more cinematically clichéd. It’s an arguably unavoidable byproduct, although the over-use of score and close-up in the final act in an effort to increase melodrama probably wasn’t. Overall, this is a solid drama made from a stellar book, but if you see it even just for the two performances, you won’t be disappointed.', 'Stephen McCallum’s “1%” could somewhat accurately be called “An Australian Sons of Anarchy,” but that might make it sound more fun than it actually is. Replacing it with little more than macho violence, this effort is lacking the Shakespearean underpinnings of the hit FX show, and the solid ensemble of it. This is one of those dramas that can’t balance its incredibly dark tone with something that feels like the journey into the grimy underbelly is worth taking. It’s the kind of film that makes you want to take a shower when it’s over to wash it off. And, yes, sometimes stories of truly violent, evil people are worth examining, but it takes stellar filmmaking or insightful writing, both of which are lacking here. The only thing that really saves it from complete disaster is another interesting performance from Abbey Lee of “The Neon Demon” and “Mad Max: Fury Road.""', '“1%” is essentially about a change in power from someone who believes in ruling through force to one who believes in ruling through politics. The latter is a charismatic leader named Mark (Ryan Corr), who has been running the motorcycle club while the sociopath President Knuck (Matt Nable, who also wrote the film) has been doing a stint behind bars. Mark has been working to grow the club and plan for the future, but his younger brother Skink (Josh McConville) gets into some trouble with some rivals. When Knuck gets out, he wants to handle the trouble with violence, whereas Mark knows this will only lead to trouble for everyone. A power struggle ensues, but it’s too difficult to really care who’s going to come out on top. At one point, someone says “He’ll fuck it up for no other reason than he likes to fight.” “1%” is a movie that has almost nothing going on other than a desire to fight.', 'Brian O’Malley’s “The Lodgers” is a better film, but one I also found frustratingly thin in its efforts to mimic classic Gothic thrillers without enough going on underneath. It starts promisingly, introducing us to a pair of fraternal twins with a very unusual situation. Rachel (Charlotte Vega) and Edward (Bill Milner) are 18-year-olds who were orphaned and left with some strict rules. For one, they’re not allowed to be outside of the house after midnight. For another, they’re not allowed to let anyone into the decrepit mansion in which they live. While a terrified Edward sticks to these rules like a religion, it feels like Rachel is starting to push the boundaries. From the beginning, we know something bad is going to happen if she does.', 'Shot in an Irish mansion that’s allegedly haunted, O’Malley’s use of the location is one of the film’s greatest strengths, and Vega is a captivating lead. The problem with “The Lodgers” comes down to thinness of concept and character. I just never quite cared about the twins or their predicament in way that would make the final act resonate. There’s enough interesting material to look forward to what O’Malley and Vega do next, but “The Lodgers” is a near-miss for this hardcore horror and Gothic thriller fan. It tries to get underneath, but remains skin-deep.

Directed by Lee Unkrich (""Toy Story 3"") and veteran Pixar animator Adrian Molina, and drawing heavily on Mexican folklore and traditional designs, it has catchy music, a complex but comprehensible plot, and bits of domestic comedy and media satire. Most of the time the movie is a knockabout slapstick comedy with a ""Back to the Future"" feeling, staging grand action sequences and feeding audiences new plot information every few minutes, but of course, being a Pixar film, ""Coco"" is also building toward emotionally overwhelming moments, so stealthily that you may be surprised to find yourself wiping away a tear even though the studio has been using the\xa0sneak-attack\xa0playbook for\xa0decades.   ', ""The film's hero, twelve-year old Miguel Riviera (voice by Anthony Gonzalez), lives in the small town of Santa Cecilia. He’s a goodhearted child who loves to play guitar and idolizes the greatest popular singer-songwriter of the 1920s and '30s, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who was killed when a huge church bell fell on his head. But Miguel has to busk in secret because his family has banned its members from performing music ever since Miguel's great-great-grandfather left, abandoning his loved ones to selfishly pursue his dreams of stardom. At least that’s the official story passed down through the generations; it’ll be challenged as the film unfolds, not through a traditional detective story (although there’s a mystery element to “Coco”) but through an “Alice in Wonderland” journey to the Land of the Dead, which the hero accesses through the tomb of his ancestors.\xa0   "", 'Family and legacy as expressed through storytelling and song: this is the deeper preoccupation of “Coco.” One of the most fascinating things about the movie is the way it builds its plot around members of Miguel’s family, living and dead, as they battle to determine the official narrative of Miguel’s great-great grandfather and what his disappearance from the narrative meant for the extended clan. The title character is the hero’s great-grandmother (Renee Victor), who was traumatized by her dad’s disappearance. In her old age, she has become a nearly silent presence, sitting in the corner and staring blankly ahead, as if hypnotized by a sweet, old film perpetually unreeling in her mind.   ', 'The machinations that get Miguel to the other side are too complicated to explain in a review, though they’re comprehensible as you watch the movie. Suffice to say that Miguel gets there, teams up with a melancholy goofball named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and has to pose as one of the dead with the aid of skeletal facepaint, but that (like Marty McFly returning to the 1950s to make sure his mom ends up with his dad in “Future”) the longer Miguel stays on the other side, the more likely he is to end up actually dead.   ', 'I’m reluctant to describe the film’s plot in too much detail because, even though every twist seems obvious in retrospect, Molina and Matthew Aldrich’s script frames each one so that seems delightful and inevitable. Many of them are conveyed through a stolen family photograph that Miguel brings with him to the Land of the Dead. The deployment of the photo is a great example of how to tell a story through pictures, or more accurately, with a picture. Somebody’s face has been torn out; there’s a guitar that proves to be important later, and there are other ways in which visual information has been withheld from Miguel (and us) so that it can be revealed or restored when the time is right, completing and correcting an incomplete or distorted picture, and ""picture.”', 'What’s freshest, though, is the tone and outlook of the film. “Coco” opened in Mexico a month before it opened in the USA and is already the highest grossing film of all time there. It assumes a non-American point-of-view on spirituality and culture—not in a touristy or “thought experiment” sort of way, but as if it were merely the latest product of an alternate universe Pixar Mexicano that has existed for just as long as the other one. The film’s stable of voice actors reads like a Who’s Who of Latin-American talent: the ensemble includes Edward James Olmos, Alfonso Arau, Ana Ofelia Murguia, Alanna Ubach and, in a small role, to my surprise and astonishment, playwright Octavio Solis, who was one of my teachers in high school back in Dallas. Michael Giacchino\'s score is unsurprisingly excellent, as are the original songs—in particular, the future Oscar winner ""Remember Me,"" the greatest tear-eruption mechanism to accompany a Pixar release since the ""Toy Story 2"" centerpiece ""When She Loved Me.""', 'Like most Pixar productions, this one is filled with homages to film history in general and animation history in particular. I was especially fond of the references to the dancing skeletons that seemed to pop up constantly in cartoon shorts from the 1930s. There’s a touch of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki in the film’s matter-of-fact depiction of the dead interacting with the living, as well as its portrayal of certain creatures, such as a goofy, goggle-eyed dog named Dante (modeled on Xoloitzcuintli, the national dog of Mexico) and a gigantic flying dragon-type beast with the personality of a plump old housecat. ', 'Also notable are the film\'s widescreen compositions, which put lots of characters in the same frame and shoot them from\xa0the waist up or from head-to-toe, in the manner of old musicals, or\xa0Hollywood comedies from the eighties like ""9 to 5"" or ""Tootsie."" The direction lets you appreciate how the characters interact with each other and with their environments and lets you decide what to look at. At first this approach seems counter-intuitive for a movie filled with fantastic creatures, structures and situations, but it ends up being effective for that very reason: it makes you feel as though you\'re seeing a record of things that are actually happening, and it makes ""Coco"" feel gentle and unassuming even though it\'s a big, brash, loud film.

', 'WHAT I LIKED\nWhen “Modern Family” first aired last fall, I wasn’t able to watch it on broadcast television. However, I kept hearing great things. While all those accolades were coming in, I wondered whether it could really be that funny. The answer is that it is that funny, and it’s a great show. ', 'The pilot is a little shaky, which isn’t uncommon. But when the show allowed all the characters to have their bizarre quirks and not try to be preachy, things really took off. Too often, a show will present parents like Claire and Phil as normal, when the reality is that these characters are just as neurotic and screwed up as anyone else on the show. That’s where the comedy is. ', 'Even when the show tries to get heartfelt and honest, it doesn’t get preachy or annoying. It keeps its messages subtle and doesn’t overdo any sort of normalcy. ', 'It takes a good chunk of the season for every character to come out of his or her shell. In the early episodes, the fatter the character, the more I liked them (with my favorites being Cameron, Manny and Jay). However, by the end of the first season, everyone gets their day. In particular, the normally reserved Mitchell gets a chance to shine as he freaks out over a pigeon in the house. His brilliance is carried over into the second season, which airs on the heels of this DVD release. ', 'Mockumentaries are hard to do, and they’re becoming a little overdone, pioneered with “Arrested Development” and perfected with “The Office.” The format works in this show, and it is executed perfectly. There’s a reason the show has won an Emmy. ', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nAs I said previously, the first episode or two takes some time for the show to find its footing. In particular, Claire and Phil’s family is presented as very normal, but they’re insane people. Like other television families, like the Scavos on “Desperate Housewives,” who are presented as the typical family even though they’re anything but.

The first was a burst of energy and a breath of fresh air in 2012. Snarky but sweet with a diverse and likable cast, it gave us a vivid look inside a specific niche of the college experience.

It’s also the reason you hear that insanely catchy Anna Kendrick “Cups” song everywhere from the pet food store to the dentist’s office.', 'Hence, in 2015, we got “Pitch Perfect 2,” which was pretty much note for note and beat for beat the same movie as the original “Pitch Perfect,” despite the endlessly talented Elizabeth Banks making her feature directing debut. It made even more money.', 'So now we have “Pitch Perfect 3.” The best thing I can say about it is that it’s not another retread of its predecessor. Instead, Kay Cannon (who’s written the screenplays for all three movies) has blown things up entirely. She maintains the overly produced pop tunes as a through line, of course—it’s the only real source of cohesion, and it’s the reason you’re here. But it’s as if she and director Trish Sie (“Step Up All In”) decided to just go nuts in this final outing, turning it into a globetrotting, James Bond-style action picture. That doesn’t necessarily make it an improvement, but it’s at least an ambitious departure.', '“Pitch Perfect 3” begins with the Bellas doing their signature dance-and-harmony bit aboard a mega-yacht to Britney Spears’ “Toxic” (which I’ll surely purge from my brain any day now). Kendrick’s Beca leads the group out onto the deck, Rebel Wilson’s Fat Amy bursts in with a fire extinguisher and the ladies all leap into the water just in time as the boat explodes behind them.', 'Then the movie flashes back three weeks to catch us up to that point. All of the Bellas are out of college now—except Hailee Steinfeld’s barely-there Emily—and struggling to find their voice (see what I did there?) in the real world. Beca has just quit her job as a music producer. Her roomie, Amy, never really has a job. And the ever-eager Chloe (Brittany Snow, game as always) has her heart set on attending veterinary school. The rest of the ladies are mostly an afterthought, each getting a line or two to update their status.', 'An invitation to join a USO tour and perform in Spain, Italy and France provides just the contrivance to reunite the Bellas for one last hurrah and prolong their avoidance of adulthood.', 'And that’s pretty much it concerning the\xa0flimsiness of the storyline that links one song to another. The numbers are lively as always, but with a sameness of energy and choreography that eventually makes them feel repetitive and numbing.', 'Several of the absurd throwaway lines are good for a laugh; as always, Kendrick is a master of the deadpan aside. And Wilson has such a wild energy and she so gleefully embraces the inappropriate that she sort of wills you into submission. You can’t help but like her—but also long for sharper material for her. And the movie leans heavily on the physicality of her comedy, as always, while adding a layer of butt-kicking bad-assery that strangely makes sense. But John Lithgow doing an intentionally over-the-top Australian accent as Amy’s shady, estranged father is a misfire and a waste of his formidable abilities.', 'Along those lines, “Pitch Perfect 3” is seriously overcrowded with new characters who never truly register, including not one but two blandly handsome potential love interests (Matt Lanter and Guy Burnet). Naturally, the Bellas find themselves in a competition while on the USO tour—this time against a generic pop-country group, a hip-hop duo and an all-female rock band called Evermoist (a name they keep saying over and over again, although it isn’t all that funny the first time). This leads to the obligatory riff-off across genres—a staple of all these movies—which feels more forced than ever.', 'And it wouldn’t be a “Pitch Perfect” movie without Banks and John Michael Higgins reprising their roles as the commentator duo serving as our passive-aggressive Greek chorus. This time, they insert themselves into the action as a bumbling documentary crew following the Bellas around on their tour.

In addition to his coverage, our contributors report the latest from Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Sundance and other movie showcases world-wide.', 'There were people who must have doubted a young American actress in the director’s chair. But could Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” be anything short of fantastic? Her turn as writing collaborator on “Mistress America” and “Frances Ha” alongside director Noah Baumbach confirmed something her fans already knew, that the actress had many more talents awaiting the right opportunities. ', 'With “Lady Bird,” Gerwig has proven that she’s equally adept behind the camera, allowing her personal experiences to inform this upbeat, charming coming-of-age comedy about a high-school senior whose ambition exceeds her family’s modest circumstances. The specific time period (the early 2000s, when Gerwig would have graduated from high school) and Saoirse Ronan’s mannerisms as being downright “Gerwigian” pretty much confirm that the story has autobiographical components. Ronan plays Christine, a girl with the kind of wit, zeal, and hormones that make her quickly outgrow her small suburban home “on the wrong side of the tracks” and Catholic school upbringing in boring ol’ Sacramento. The film’s got a slew of teenage-girl drama beats—dumping her bestie for the popular kid, dating the cool guy who ends up not being so cool, screaming at her mom who’s trying to do right by her but who’s also annoyingly cloying—but somehow Gerwig manages to make the many emotional arcs and moving narrative parts all work flawlessly. ', 'This perhaps has to do with the frenetic speed with which “Lady Bird” moves—by the way, that’s the name Christine pretentiously has taken on in order to set herself apart from all her peers. Gerwig is working in the same self-deprecating but entirely empathetic style as Woody Allen, Albert Brooks, and Whit Stillman (whose “Damsels in Distress” features Gerwig in an adorkable role). Gerwig’s directorial and editing speed helps flesh out multiple mini-narratives at once—like the best friend’s crush on their math teacher and a slightly socially awkward father/son subplot in which the younger man gets a job over his much more experienced father—that might normally be more fleshed out fully in a TV series. It’s like Gerwig knows she doesn’t have a lot of time to work with in a film narrative, so she wisely amps up the pace of the narrative and the barrel of raillery to ensure we can keep up and actually enjoy her cinematic joie de vivre. ', '“Woman Walks Ahead” is a Jessica Chastain vehicle directed by Susannah White that tries to paint a historical picture of the treatment of Native Americans in the 1800s. Chastain plays Catherine Wheldon, a painter who takes on the challenging journey to Dakota to do a portrait of Sitting Bull (Michael Greyeyes). Her timing is prescient, as politicians are trying to force local chiefs, including Sitting Bull, to sign off on a demeaning treaty. We see the story mostly from the perspective of Catherine, whose New York privilege didn’t prepare her for the dusty, Dakota plains and cold, rude, and occasionally physically threatening treatment from locals who believe she’s a spy or activist trying to help the Aboriginal cause and interfere with their politicking. ', 'Catherine’s arduous journey in the first leg of the film leads slowly but surely to an unlikely friendship with Sitting Bull, but their dynamic has very little spark. “Woman Walks Ahead” is dutifully respectful to Native American culture and Catherine offers us the white “gateway” perspective to better understand and empathize with the native culture; this is a film that understands exactly the tropes it must use to deliver its story, and gently and gracefully settles into them, through a series of insightful conversations that can empower both marginalized lead characters. The film does some justice to the stakes that are in play when privileged folks like Catherine try to get involved to make a difference, only to become helpless when colonialist machinations overtake them (it’s hard to give away the ending since we all know the horrendous treatment of Native Americans at that time). ', 'Yet somehow, despite all the film’s best intentions, not to mention the film’s emotional and political intelligence in handling the complex power dynamics of the story, a crucial element that would help viewers truly engage with the material—Catherine’s friendship with a chief whose brave stance marks him as a target and scapegoat—is disappointingly boring. As we come to learn more about Sitting Bull’s culture as he learns how to best pose for his portrait, which sometimes involves him disrobing, only hints at a small degree of sexual tension, but the film wisely chooses not to go down that path. But without romance, humor or anything else—for example, it could have further explored the artistic connection between Catherine and Sitting Bull—that might enliven the material, “Woman Walks Ahead” remains stagnant as a politically correct but enervating historical drama. ', 'Narrative problems seem to be a consistent motif at the films playing at TIFF this year. For every “Lady Bird,” there’s at least a dozen films like “Woman Walks Ahead,” or even worse, “Marrowbone,” an English-language Spanish production directed by Sergio G. Sanchez. It’s hard to know where to begin with this family drama/suspense thriller, about a large British family who attempts to escape the devastation, social shame, and abuse brought upon them by their sadistic, monstrous father who murdered scores of victims. Rose’s (Nicola Harrison) idea of a fresh start involves moving her children back to her family home in America. Twenty-one-year-old Jack (George MacKay), 19-year-old Jane (Mia Goth), 18-year-old Billy (Charlie Heaton), and five-year-old Sam (Matthew Stagg) try to keep going after Rose passes away, maintaining a low profile in their large, rural estate, with only a close friendship with the neighboring girl, Allie (Anya Taylor-Joy) to keep them sane. ', 'But then a scene early on in the film re-establishes the threatening presence of the father having found them at last. The movie then fades to black before proceeding as if the previous scene hadn’t happened; anyone familiar with Hollywood storytelling knows a twist is afoot. Far too much convoluted plotting later, involving the random insertion of a ghost haunting the house, a jealous love triangle, and a potential blackmail involving the family’s “blood money” stolen from their father leads, to a penultimate reckoning in which a greedy banking associate hacks his way into the family’s cellar and reveals the family’s dirty hidden secrets, which includes one member’s split-personality disorder and a complete 180-degree turn on how to predict everything that happened before. It’s so hard to explain this movie without ruining everything, but in addition to the inexplicably terrible story, “Marrowbone” is the kind of precious, self-serious film that doesn’t understand that scenes like a teenage son carving “DAD” into a bullet, and a character walking into a library commenting on how many books there are, are downright risible. The film’s one saving grace lies in its ability to craft some truly suspenseful moments, but when the viewer has no inkling what exactly they should be scared of—a ghost, a real person, or the family’s overactive imagination?—for the vast majority of the running time, a few brushes with satisfactory filmmaking craft is a moot thing to champion in a film this mucked up.

Leonard faces various problems with his real relationship with Penny, the pretty girl next door. Wolowitz is still living with his mother but manages to date as well this season. Koothrappali plays the silent wingman through all this while Sheldon continues to be Sheldon in the most annoying way. ', 'WHAT I LIKED\nI came to this series a little late when the second season DVD showed up in my mail, and I was hooked almost immediately. Some might say this is because I’m a geek at heart, have been to Comic-Con multiple times and understand pretty much every reference to nerd culture in teh series. And they’d be absolutely right. “The Big Bang Theory” understands the appeal of the geek lifestyle, and it heralds it as well as points out its obvious flaws. ', 'But even without any geek knowledge, you can still enjoy “The Big Bang Theory.” Wipe away all of the comic book references and science mumbo-jumbo, and you have a very basic American sit com about lonely guys living across the hall from the beautiful girl. It’s not the same scenario, but this show has a real “Three’s Company” feel to it. It doesn’t try to solve the world’s problems, but rather gives its loyal audience a chance to laugh and escape for a half hour each week. ', 'Like many series, “The Big Bang Theory” really hits a stride in the third season. It continues the geek references, showing love for Green Lantern (as a lantern toy becomes a bargaining chip for Sheldon), having a sexy cameo for Katee Sackoff and a brilliant double cameo with Wil Wheaton (a geek at heart himself). ', 'I also appreciated the Leonard/Penny love story not overshadowing the rest of the show. It’s one of the critical elements, but unlike a show like “Cheers,” the stability of the romance does not dictate the success of the series. ', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nNot a whole lot. Right now, “The Big Bang Theory” is one of the best sit coms on television. As it gears up for its fourth season, it’s something that can be enjoyed by people in many different demographics. There’s really nothing about it that bothers me. ', 'DVD FEATURES\nThe third season Blu-ray includes a relatively thin amount of special features. It’s not barren, but there really should be more on here, especially for just a third season. ', 'There’s a gag reel, which actually is pretty well put together and quite funny.

In addition to his coverage, our contributors report the latest from Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Sundance and other movie showcases world-wide.', 'The Midnight Madness (MM) program at the Toronto International Film Festival can be notoriously hit and miss. For every “Raw” or “It Follows,” there a half-dozen films that most people outside of TIFF will never see. It has always been an admirably diverse program, offering films from around the world of varying definitions of the word “midnight.” They’re typically horror, but thrillers and black comedies can fit the bill as well. And the 2017 iteration of Midnight Madness was promising enough that I saw most of it—8 out of 10 to be precise, missing only the soon-to-be-VOD “Brawl in Cell Block 99” and something called “Vampire Clay.” So I’ll break up the 8 I saw into two chunks in the order they premiered. This first quartet is shockingly strong, featuring three films that I suspect will make notable waves when they make their way south from Toronto.', 'Let’s start with the best, the harrowing and thrilling “Revenge,” a debut from French director Coralie Fargeat, who offers a fascinating female perspective on the typically male-directed genre of the rape revenge movie. And she does so with ample style, remarkable tension, decidedly French black humor, and more blood than I believe the human body actually contains. There’s one every year but this is the 2017 MM during which someone actually fainted from the intensity.', 'Jen (Matilda Lutz) is a gorgeous young woman who has come to a stylish, modern house in the middle of nowhere with her married boyfriend (Kevin Jannsens). They’re going to have some fun in a place where privacy isn’t really a concern because there are no other human beings for miles. Jen is going to leave in a couple days and her boy toy is going to go hunting, but his big game buddies show up early. They can’t stop staring at Jen, but things seem relatively safe and playful until the next morning when her boyfriend is off getting the hunting permits. Jen is raped and eventually left in the middle of nowhere for dead. The title should give away pretty much what happens next.', ""“Revenge” is a remarkably gory and bloody film, but it’s not merely an exercise in revulsion. It’s also blackly humorous and unexpected in its twists and turns. These men are evil and weak, and Jen realizes she’s stronger than she probably thought she was. There’s also an interesting subtext about the kinds of men that make this horror possible given that one of the trio is the actual rapist, the other is the slob who looks the other way, and the final man is the enabler, the guy who betrays the women in his life and makes a violent world safer for those who would commit violence. It's a much smarter, braver movie than most films like this.\xa0"", 'Of course, all vengeance movies have a thrilling undercurrent of justice served in as bloody a fashion as possible, but Corgeat’s eye for composition and tension is also remarkable for a debut director. The color palette of sun-drenched hunting plains balanced with the sharp lines of a millionaire’s villa make for a film that’s never less than visually fascinating. And then there’s the blood. SO much blood. There’s one particular scene that had my audience literally screaming, and that kind of communal response to a horror movie is still such a unique joy. This is the 2017 Midnight Madness horror film most likely to take genre nuts by surprise.', ""It's not a horror film, but Joseph Kahn’s “Bodied” may be an even bigger surprise overall when it comes to expectations. Kahn’s best film to date is, believe it or not, a satire of PC culture as seen through the world of battle rap, produced by Eminem. Written by Alex Larsen (aka Kid Twist), a member of the Toronto battle rap scene himself, “Bodied” offers an entertaining window into a culture that most people probably know very little about, but it’s also a clever take on a generation more aware of what’s offensive and what’s not than any before. It pushes through most tone-deaf satires of wokeness by taking the concept of being “problematic” to, well, extremes. It’s tempting to say it’s the kind of film that could offend literally everyone—and all-purpose “-ism” is certainly a subtext—but the material is so smartly handled that Larsen and Kahn get away with it. They almost reach a level of equality in the battle raps in that if everyone is insulted, if nothing is off limits, if people own their culture’s greatest stereotypes, then they are all on equal footing."", 'A great turn from Calum Worthy (who really looks like a lost Gleeson brother) anchors “Bodied”—and some people will already be turned off by the “white eyes on a minority culture” perspective, but that’s kind of the point here. Worthy’s Adam is a progressive grad student who is fascinated by battle rap culture. He considers it the closest thing we have to modern poetry, even if his girlfriend can’t stand the rampant homophobia, racism, and misogyny. When Adam gets asked to participate in a battle rap himself, he reveals how much all this observation has given him the skills to compete himself. He befriends a battle rap star named Ben Grym, and a few other luminaries of the field, and works to navigate the thin ice of being a white battle rapper, learning that he only wins when he takes the PC gloves off, but that doesn’t leave a lot of room for friendship. ', 'I like how much “Bodied” allows us to dislike Adam. Especially in some key climactic moments, he’s kind of an asshole. And he doesn’t understand a lot of the world around him—thinking that observing minority cultures gives him a knowledge that it just doesn’t. There are messages on top of messages in “Bodied,” and there will be many a thinkpiece about it, but it’s also just wildly entertaining. Few movies can name-check Tilda Swinton, Biggie, Super Mario Bros. and Hermione Granger, along with many more. You know those incredibly entertaining battle raps in “8 Mile”? Imagine like 100 minutes of those. “Bodied” is way too long, but it’s a movie that’s going to get people talking. Someone like Netflix would be smart to pick it up yesterday.', 'Already picked up, trailered, and ready to blow your mind is James Franco’s “The Disaster Artist,” a hysterical comedy about the making of the notorious cult classic “The Room.” There’s something deeply meta about the fact that Franco’s best film as a director is a movie about making films with your best friends given how often he does just that, including casting people like Seth Rogen and his brother Dave Franco in this one. James Franco clearly relates to Tommy Wiseau on one level in that both are passionate creators who often make instinctual decisions instead of logical ones. It just happens that one of them was deeply untalented.', ""James Franco also plays Wiseau, but the film is mostly told through the eyes of Dave Franco’s Greg Sestero, a young actor in San Francisco who meets Tommy in an acting class. The two move to Los Angeles together, where Wiseau has an apartment. How Wiseau has enough money to have apartments in multiple cities is a mystery—as is his actual age and country of origin and maybe if he's a vampire (kidding, but only a little). He tells people he’s in his twenties and from New Orleans. Obviously, neither are true. After hitting a bunch of Hollywood roadblocks, Greg suggests they make their own movie. The rest is history."", 'The production of “The Room” as portrayed in “The Disaster Artist” was an absolute nightmare. Much of it is hysterical, but it’s also interesting how much Franco and company are willing to let Tommy be a total asshole. This is not some sort of hero worship—the guy is a maniac, who clearly had no idea what he was doing, something that only dawns on most of the people making the film, including Greg, over time. However, the throughline for “The Disaster Artist” is the friendship between Greg and Tommy, and how often they were willing to support each other, even when logic dictated they probably shouldn’t. ', 'Most of all, “The Disaster Artist” is just really funny. Now, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that some of the movie feels poorly made. Why did it have to be shot so much on handheld? Franco is also a much better actor than he is director. His performance here is phenomenal, and not just as an act of mimickry, but the film feels a bit too loose and shapeless, and then surprisingly pat when it comes to its messages of friendship and creative passion. Now, one could argue that a poorly-made movie deserves a poorly-made movie, but that feels more coincidental than intentional. Again, Franco rules and the movie is really, really funny, and that’s all that truly matters. Franco remains one of the most fascinating performers of his generation, even if his directing ability needs a little work. Tommy and Greg should be proud.', 'Finally, we get to David Brucker’s disappointing “The Ritual,” a film that starts with an effective inciting incident but devolves into something that feels overly familiar. The director of a great segment from “Southbound” and co-director of “The Signal” is undeniably talented, but this project feels half-baked, like someone had a great idea but then never developed it to a place where it would carry its own movie. ', 'Rafe Spall’s performance is the best thing about “The Ritual.” The actor plays Luke, a vocal leader of a quintet of male friends out one night trying to plan a “lads’ trip.” Vegas? Amsterdam? Hiking? Luke doesn’t like the last idea, but their lives change forever when one of the members of this group dies in a horrifying robbery. Luke is in a position where he possibly could have saved his friend, but he chooses not to. If you’re thinking that will come back to haunt him, you’ve seen a horror movie before.', 'Luke and his remaining three buddies take the hiking trip to honor their friend, and one of them twists an ankle. Rather than take the safe road back to the lodge, they try to take a shortcut. As horror fans know, never take a shortcut. They start seeing etchings in trees, and come upon a decrepit cabin in the woods. That night, they have horrific nightmares, and then things get even stranger. Sadly, “The Ritual” is one of those movies in which as things get stranger they get less interesting. The movie lost me about halfway through.

comedy "['From the creators of Gilmore Girls, comes the absolutely delightful and hilarious, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Equal parts adorable and comedic, this new Amazon series explores the life of a 1958 housewife, Miriam “Midge” Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) living in Manhattan with her perfect husband, perfect family, and perfect life. The series encapsulates the 50’s with a nostalgic, jazzy soundtrack that whisks the audience away into the decade of a cookie-cutter lifestyle and doo-wop music.', 'When Midge is first introduced, we meet her as a simple, charming, cute woman who goes above and beyond for her husband, Joel (Michael Zegen), who is an aspiring comedian. So much so, that she prepares a brisket (EVERY TIME!) to convince the booker at the comedy club in Greenwich Village to give him the optimal time slot. She is basically the epitome of a supportive wife, jotting down notes during his performances and giving him ideas for his acts. However, all this comes to a startling halt one night, when his (plagiarized) act fails, and in total frustration, he walks away from their marriage. This night reveals and defines Midge’s marvelous character for the series as she finds herself in a drunken stupor on the stage cracking jokes, with the audience laughing in uproar.', 'From here on, we see Midge’s character find herself, and discover a passion she never knew she had. The transformation from a 1950’s housewife to finding herself as a stand-up comedian was executed beautifully by Brosnahan, who was the perfect casting for this role. She possessed the sweet and sour essence of Midge who becomes a force to be reckoned with as she realizes her importance in the world goes far beyond the social expectations of the 50’s; the idea one must be a perfect mother, daughter, and wife. Midge’s journey continues as she finds a friend in comedy club employee, Susie Meyerson (Alex Borstein) who witnesses her drunken act and becomes her number one advocate, and later her manager. Borstein delivers a hilariously epic performance as Brosnahan’s counterpart, and their dynamic is the soul of the show.', 'The supporting cast is nothing short of amazing including Midge’s uptight and high-strung parents played by Tony Shaloub and Marin Hinkle, and Joel’s overbearing and pushy parents played by Kevin Pollak and Caroline Aaron. Together, they bring an entertaining addition to the show with their prying and nosy parental involvement.', 'The series is through and through everything that is amazing and frustrating about the 50’s, ranging from social expectations of females to the phenomenal music. It was a treat and an absolute delight to watch a series that didn’t falter in shattering the social norms via Midge’s character, who herself underestimated the power she possessed.

It was like Britney Spears announcing she was redoing the Billie Holiday back catalogue. Or like action director McG claiming he was going to re-envision ""Citizen Kane."" ', 'Suffice it to say, there was a lack of confidence. After all, this was a network that managed to bring the British hit ""Coupling"" to these shores, air it nearly verbatim with American actors and somehow still suck the humor completely out of it. NBC, in fact, has a history of miscalculating British genius for an American audience. And lest it slip anyone\'s mind, the network hasn\'t put anything truly funny on the air since ""Scrubs"" -- and yes, NBC, that includes ""Joey."" ', 'But now, well, this is slightly embarrassing: The American version of ""The Office"" is not only funny, it creatively pays homage to the original (the first episode is the British version nearly verbatim) and then, in subsequent episodes, comes up with completely separate scripts that define the NBC edition as unique and audaciously clever in its own right. ', 'The soul-sucking Wernham Hogg paper supply company in dank Slough is now the Dunder Mifflin paper supply company in equally bleak Scranton, Pa. All the original characters are present, with names changed and attributes more Americanized. The background co-workers are equally as beaten down and depressed looking. Ambition is stunted. Making it until 5 p.m. is still the main goal. And yes, that lonely, ringing phone remains. ', 'If you\'re a loyalist (as most critics are) and even the concept of a knock-off is offensive, consider this: You can still buy the BBC version of ""The Office"" on DVD and enjoy the wonderfully dry, painfully realized look at dull office life working for a dull company in a dull town. It will remind you that ""The Office"" is simultaneously depressing and joyously hilarious, a kind of ""Dilbert"" meets ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" by way of ""This Is Spinal Tap."" ', 'But let\'s not obscure history, here. Even in England, ""The Office"" was not a show for everyone. And many Americans, spurred on by critics on these shores, turned to BBC America and, well, didn\'t get it. Others got it -- but didn\'t like it. ', 'Who expected, then, that NBC would, in adapting the original, keep the most daring aspects -- the deadly serious mockumentary spoof style, the lack of a laugh track, the presence of awkward silences and inherently nervous comedic encounters? ', 'What NBC has managed to do with ""The Office"" is make something true to the original while expanding on the vision and completely avoiding the dour stupidity of the current American sitcom. That, in case you haven\'t figured it out yet, is nearly miraculous. ', 'In fact, NBC\'s ""Office"" gets better in future episodes once it distances itself from the British script of the pilot. No good can come of mimicking brilliance. As the show\'s boss, Steve Carell is wonderful, but suffers in comparison to the original\'s Ricky Gervais. Carell\'s character, Michael Scott, is a different kind of obnoxious oaf than Gervais\' David Brent. Gervais played Brent as delusionally unexamined, a boss with no clue that he was incompetent and annoying and that everyone secretly loathed him. Carell (of Comedy Central\'s ""The Daily Show"") plays his version of the lead with more grating self-importance, an above-board annoyance he\'s aware of and uses to bully those around him. It\'s a wonderful performance, and enormous credit must go to Carell. ', 'Once past Thursday\'s pilot, where co-workers Dwight (Rainn Wilson) and Jim (John Krasinski) and receptionist Pam (Jenna Fischer) seem less interesting or developed than their British counterparts, they subsequently begin to grow on you, to define themselves, to ""pop,"" as TV executives like to say. ', 'Ah, but back to the original sentiment of the first paragraph. What happens when a network as easy to deride as NBC actually comes through with something not only inspired but aggressively risky? It may appease critics, but will anyone watch? Make no mistake about it, ""The Office"" is unlike most other American sitcoms. The pacing and punch lines and humor are bravely off- kilter. But different -- even when it\'s lovely and thrilling to behold -- often fails to connect with the masses. Look no further than Fox\'s ""Arrested Development"" or NBC\'s own ""Scrubs"" for proof. ', 'The fear here is that ""The Office,"" despite its impressive reincarnation in America, may be a tough sell. Its humor is dry and odd. The subtleness so fretted over by lovers of the original is boldly intact. And you probably don\'t need to be reminded of how subtle plays in Peoria. ']" "[' Comedy']" "The Office"

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Roger Ebert has attended international film festivals and events for almost half a century, from the Kolkata International Film Festival to the Academy Awards. In addition to his coverage, our contributors report the latest from Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, Sundance and other movie showcases world-wide.', 'Alexander Payne’s latest finishes its fall festival trifecta after premiering at Venice and Telluride while a pair of “smaller” films actually feel like more complete, well-considered efforts, despite their own flaws. “Downsizing” has already become one of the most divisive films at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, producing responses all across the board. I know a few critics who consider it one of Payne’s best, but more seem to fall into the “ambitious disappointment” camp, and I may be even a step below that group. It’s easily Payne’s worst film, a work that’s woefully misguided, casually racist, thematically incomplete, and tries to ride on a high concept until a ham-fisted message arrives in the final act to really drive the hypocrisy home. ', 'The concept of “Downsizing” is the kind of thing with which someone like Charlie Kaufman could have worked wonders. As human consumption has essentially destroyed our planet, a group of scientists determines that the only way to reverse the trajectory of time is to minimize not only the waste of our species but our actual size. Think about how much less damage we would do to the planet if we were only a fraction of the size we are now. Imagine how far your dollar could go when 1,000 square foot house looks much, much bigger. Everyone could have a mansion, and produce a negligible amount of planet-damaging waste.', 'For Paul (Matt Damon) and his wife Audrey (Kristen Wiig), the allure of what has been just outside of their reach becoming available to them through downsizing is too much to ignore. What could possibly go wrong? Of course, the journey to the small life doesn’t go exactly as planned, while Christoph Waltz, Jason Sudeikis, Hong Chau, and cameos from Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern fill out an undeniably talented cast. Once again, Payne wants to examine the current state of America through a satirical, exaggerated lens.', 'The problem this time is that I don’t think he knows what he’s looking at. There are plenty of questions in ""Downsizing."" How do we literally simplify our lives? What should we value? How can one person make a minor difference against major problems? However, none of these are interestingly examined beyond the superficial. Instead, Payne meanders through a surprisingly unfunny narrative about a wanderer, amplified by Damon’s least interesting performance in a very long time. The problem is that Paul needs to be either a Chauncey Billups-esque observer or something more exaggerated than the blank slate Damon presents. There\'s no character here, and not even in an interesting, non-character way. The idea that this guy just bounces from decision to decision, never making long-term ones, feels underdeveloped thematically, and just leaves us with a film that\'s as unfocused as its protagonist. ', 'Part of the tonal dilemma presented by “Downsizing” is the bad taste left in the mouth by Payne’s willingness not only to present a remarkable degree of White Savior Complex but then dive headfirst into casual racism in the portrayal of a Vietnamese dissident whose broken English is clearly being played for laughs. Payne has been accused of condescension to his ""less refined,"" Midwestern characters before but I never felt it as strongly as I did here. It feels like there was a version of “Downsizing” that was broader, in which everyone felt satirical, but then certain characters were softened, leaving only a few stereotypes to stand out and offend, along with an overriding sense of superiority from the filmmaker. Throughout “Downsizing,” I kept asking myself what the point of all of this was, never engaged by its hodgepodge of themes. I wish the filmmakers had asked that question too.', 'If “Downsizing” posits that great things can be achieved by small people, the thriller “Beast” takes a more cynical look at human behavior. It features a truly breakthrough performance (maybe two) and announces writer/director Michael Pearce as a talent to watch. Some have compared it to Andrea Arnold, but that’s a bit unfair in that Pearce’s film embraces the thriller genre a bit more completely, turning into something unexpected and terrifying. I’m not sure it all comes together, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the film became important for introducing us to Pearce, Jessie Buckley, and Johnny Flynn.', 'Buckley plays Moll, a troubled young woman in a relatively isolated community who doesn’t seem to have many options for adventure or escape. Her family is relatively horrible, forcing her to run off on the very occasion of her birthday party just to escape them. After a night of drinking and clubbing, she ends up in an isolated location with a male stranger, who gets a little too aggressive. Stepping into the rescue is a mysterious stranger named Pascal (Flynn), who becomes Moll’s boyfriend. He’s the opposite of her family—rugged, athletic, and dangerous. Maybe too dangerous. Did I mention there’s a serial killer in town? Even Moll starts to wonder if the “bad boy” is really that bad.', 'The most daring question that “Beast” asks is whether or not Moll is desperate enough and in love enough to forgive Pascal even if he is a serial killer. Flynn is stellar, blending natural screen charisma and an undercurrent of menace. But the movie belongs to Buckley, a young actress who could easily become a star. She shades Moll with just enough of her own sociopathology that it adds a layer of uncertainty that “Beast” would otherwise lack. We could easily see Moll running off with Pascal in a “Bonnie and Clyde” orgy of violence, or turning her boyfriend in if he ends up being a murderer. She’s fully immersed in the most important chapter of her life to date and Buckley conveys this in ways that don’t feel melodramatic or manipulative. It’s a great performance.', 'There’s another great performance that anchors the more disappointing drama “Who We Are Now,” a well-intentioned story of a woman struggling for her rights that falls flat in the dialogue apartment even if it contains a few standout performances from underrated actors. The always-phenomenal Julianne Nicholson, also at TIFF in “I, Tonya,” plays Beth, an ex-con who is fighting with her sister to get custody of her child. When she went away for manslaughter, she signed over custody rights, but she did it from a hospital bed and presumed she’d take the mother role back when she got out. In the meantime, her sister didn’t even tell the child about her mother, and he thinks Beth is his aunt. Participating in the legal battle to come is an idealistic young attorney named Jess (Emma Roberts) and her boss (Jimmy Smits). Zachary Quinto co-stars as a love interest for Beth while Jason Biggs appears as a scumbag who takes advantage of Beth’s situation.', 'There are talented people involved in “Who We Are Now,” including “From Nowhere” writer/director Matthew Newton, but I fundamentally didn’t believe too much of what happens in this low-key drama. On one level, it’s designed to be a character piece, but it’s also too eager to make statements and too willing to embrace caricatures. Of course, Jess’ mother is the materialistic opposite of her daughter. Of course, the counsel opposing Smits (played by Gloria Reuben) is cavalierly cruel. Of course, we’ll learn the details of Beth’s crime in an emotional climax. “Who We Are Now” just ticks too many cliched boxes, particularly in the dialogue department. People don’t as often say what they’re thinking and feeling and needing as these characters do. Buried in all of that is another great performance from Nicholson (and a reminder that I wish Smits did more film work), but it’s not enough to save the film overall.', '\nNext Article: TIFF 2017: “The Upside,” “The Captain”\nPrevious Article: The Greatest Show on Earth: Recap of the 2017 Telluride Film Festival\n', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

Arnold arms the missile and fires it, terrorist attached, straight through the high-rise, and it shoots down a helicopter carrying other terrorists. This takes place, I might add, shortly after a nuclear bomb has vaporized one of the Florida keys.', 'It\'s stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and ""True Lies"" has a lot of it: Laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don\'t take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity. Schwarzenegger has found himself in a lot of unlikely situations in his action-packed career, and ""True Lies"" seems determined to raise the ante - to go over the top with outlandish and extravagant special effects scenes.', 'Consider, for example, a chase sequence near the beginning of the movie, in which a bad guy on a motorcycle is chased by Arnold, on a horse, through a hotel lobby. Most movies would be content with that. Not ""True Lies,"" which continues the chase on high-rise elevators and ends up on the hotel roof, with Arnold urging the horse to attempt a free fall into a swimming pool.', 'The plot is, of course, little more than a clothesline upon which to hang such set pieces. It involves Schwarzenegger as Harry, an ace U.S. spy, who has been married for 15 years to a sweet-tempered wife named Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who thinks he is a computer salesman. (He works for something called the Omega Force, which describes itself in its seal as ""The Last Line of Defense."") How he has successfully managed this deception is one of the many questions the film does not pause to answer.', 'As the film opens, Schwarzenegger and his partner Gib (Tom Arnold) are involved in a James Bondian attempt to infiltrate a rich arms dealer\'s black tie party in a Swiss chateau. To say security is tight would be an understatement; the guards have machine guns and attack dogs. At the party, Schwarzenegger meets the beautiful Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere, looking much more elegant than in ""Wayne\'s World"") and tangos with her before accomplishing his mission and surviving a bloody getaway. (Schwarzenegger\'s tangoing ability is reflected by the decision to film most of the dance as head-and-shoulders shots.) Cut back to Washington, D.C., and Schwarzenegger\'s life of uneventful domestic tranquillity (his wife thinks he was out of town at a sales convention). But then, when it appears the dealer has sold four atomic weapons to a terrorist gang, it\'s up to Schwarzenegger and the surprisingly engaging Tom Arnold to stop them.', 'In between the action packed first and third acts, however, is a curious second act in which Schwarzenegger becomes convinced that his wife is fooling around with a car salesman (Bill Paxton).', ""This leads to an elaborate charade in a hotel room, where, for reasons that are much too complicated to summarize here, Jamie Lee Curtis impersonates a hooker and Schwarzenegger impersonates her client. (We are supposed to believe she doesn't recognize her husband because he has a light behind him.) Curtis earns some laughs here, doing a quasi-striptease. The physical humor is effective, and she's charmingly sexy and klutzy."", ""But the whole scene smells fishy. If you take a step back from the movie and really think about the trick the spy is playing on his wife, it's cruel and not funny. And it sidetracks the plot. The movie is 135 minutes long, and at 120, without some of the hotel room escapade, it would be a lot better."", 'The director, James Cameron, is a master of action (he worked with Schwarzenegger on ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""), and when he\'s doing his thing, no one does it better. That includes the third act of the movie, in which a breathless Miami newscaster reports on a high-rise terrorist drama, and barely has time to squeeze in the information that an A-bomb has just blown up one of the Keys.', 'Cameron is credited with the screenplay (which is ""based on"" a French screenplay by three others), and keeps a nice undertone of humor going. When we\'re learning about one of the evil terrorists, for example, here\'s the exchange: ""They call him the Sand Spider."" ""Why?"" ""Probably because it sounds scary."" One nice surprise is Tom Arnold, who has a major role - the equal of Curtis\' - and fills it nicely. He has an everyman quality about him, and an ability to deliver an irreverent aside, which make him a good foil for Schwarzenegger. And when he gives advice on divorce and marriage, which he does frequently, he sounds as if he speaks from experience.', '""True Lies"" doesn\'t rank as high as ""Terminator 2"" and ""Total Recall"" (1990) among Schwarzenegger\'s action epics for a couple of reasons: The unconvincing interlude where the hero suspects adultery, and the perfunctory nature of the plot.

Set almost a whole year after the first season, and telling a self contained story (though one that obviously builds out of the first season) which takes place over just a couple of days (in fact, more or less half the season takes place on a single day and night), it feels more like watching a follow-up movie than the next set of instalments in a series that is reported to run another two years yet.', 'The idea is emphasised further by the fact its form seems largely inspired by The Empire Strikes Back — well, it’s Stranger Things: of course it borrows heavily from an ’80s movie.

It’s a problem many binge-focussed series have these days, but this struck me as a particularly pronounced example. It could just be my own fault for watching it all in double-bills, but then I do that quite routinely with Netflix shows and I’ve not felt it so keenly before. Nonetheless, it has enough moving parts that the two-part finale (it’s not officially billed as that, but it is that) remains highly satisfying. As with season one, it’s when everyone finally comes together to fight the threat that the season is at its most satisfying, those two episodes feeling like an adrenaline-fuelled mini-movie (well, movie-length movie) of their own.', 'Now, you can’t discuss Stranger Things 2 without mentioning the infamous Chapter Seven. If you’ve missed the internet’s collective exclamation of disappointment and/or annoyance, IMDb has it in a nutshell: on there, the user ratings of all the other episodes (from both seasons) range from 8.5 to 9.5, a spread of 1.0 (obviously), but Chapter Seven has 6.2, a full 2.3 marks below the next lowest score. Ouch. It’s not great, but I didn’t think it was that bad. It’s a total aside from the main action, and placed where it is seems designed just to delay the pay-off to Chapter Six’s cliffhanger for another 45 minutes (in a regular programme it’d be two weeks, but this is Netflix). I don’t really hold with that being an actual problem, though — that’s just taste. No, the real problem is that it rushes through a character arc for Eleven that would’ve been better presented over multiple episodes. Considering before that she’s spent several episodes just sat around watching TV, there were surely better ways to structure her role this season.', 'That’s no slight on Millie Bobby Brown’s performance, mind — she’s great again, displaying so much character and emotion even through Eleven’s limited understanding of being a normal person. Also worthy of note is Noah Schnapp as Will. Considering he had so little to do in season one, they either lucked out with his casting or knew where they were going enough to cast it well — a lot is asked of him here, and he’s up to it. I could keep going, but if we begin to single people out we’ll be here all day: almost every lead cast member gets either a stand-out scene or a decent arc. They even made Steve likeable. Finn Wolfhard draws the short straw — Mike spends most of the season just being grumpy about Eleven — but as he was the centre of attention last time it’s okay to let the others shine.', 'Even though it has all the big action stuff you’d expect, Chapter Nine still devotes a serious chunk of time to a character-focussed epilogue; reminding you that, as with most loved shows, the heart of it is the characters and their relationships. Indeed, although the season as a whole didn’t have the same effectiveness as the first, I thought the finale was a better climax. In fact, it would be a perfectly valid place to leave the entire series… but there are (at least) two more seasons to go. It might be nice if season three opened up the timeline a bit, because so far Hawkins seems to be a place where Crazy Terrible Shit happens over a couple of days and then everything’s fine for a whole year.', 'Red Dwarf XII \xa0Episodes 4-6\nI had nice things to say about the first half of Red Dwarf XII in my last TV column, which kindly glossed over the fact that episode three, Timewave, was a bit of a disaster. I think it’s safe to say the second half of the series is stronger — it represents everything I said last time, but better. The final two episodes, M-Corp and Skipper, even throw in some fan-pleasing callbacks — real deep-dives too, aimed squarely at the long-term fanbase. (No spoilers here — the last episode has been available on demand for a week but doesn’t officially air until tonight.) The episodes don’t need such devotee delights just to curry favour — their concept-driven comedy is satisfying enough to stand on its own — but there’s no denying the added pleasure to be found in the references and cameos. You can certainly hear the glee of the live studio audience as they recognise what’s going on each time (it even messes up the pacing of one bit for us regular viewers, but I guess that’s the trade-off). So, even more than last time, this set of episodes demonstrate there’s definitely life in the old Dwarf yet. Bring on series XIII.', 'Peaky Blinders \xa0Series 3\nBeginning with a significant time-jump and monumental change in circumstance worthy of a Mad Men season premiere, the third series of Peaky Blinders soon sees everyone’s favourite Brummie gangsters embroiled in espionage and counter-espionage as they’re enlisted to help exiled Russian aristocracy launch a bid to reclaim their country. There’s so much more going on than that, but I won’t get into it here because we’ll be here all day — Peaky Blinders is a complexly plotted series; right up the final episode, which contains revelations that turn the previous six hours on their head. Even with all that narrative to get through, it still finds plenty of time to give most of its large-ish ensemble cast some strong character arcs. There are a few streaming series that could learn a thing or two from that…', 'Rick and Morty \xa0Season 1 Episode 2\nI confess: I started watching Rick and Morty fully expecting to hate it. I’d always thought it looked and sounded annoying, so I paid it no heed… but then it seemed to keep coming up — people referring to it in excited tones, and it ranking 7th on IMDb’s top TV list. So I decided to see what all the fuss was about, still expecting my initial impressions to be proved correct but endeavouring to have an open mind. The pilot (which I covered back in August) did little to sway my mind: it wasn’t terrible, but it had many of the irritations I’d perceived and only a few redeeming qualities. But I read that it was an unrepresentative and below par episode, so I pressed on. Things immediately pick up: the second episode, Lawnmower Dog, mixes together Inception, Nightmare on Elm Street, and super-intelligent canines into an entertaining and clever half-hour. It’s bought my attention for a couple more episodes, at any rate.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have mostly been missing Mindhunter, David Fincher’s new Netflix series about the early days of criminal psychology and criminal profiling at the FBI. It was actually released before my last TV post, but I didn’t have Netflix at the time so I didn’t bother to mention it. I would watch it next, but The Punisher is out tomorrow. Maybe after that…', 'And again, I’ve seen… none of the above. I must be an outcast from the cultural Zeitgeist or something. Sure, I’ve not got Netflix and unlikely to anytime soon, but there’s American God’s and Outlander season 3 on Amazon that I haven’t gotten around to yet. And I’ve missed a new series of Red Dwarf. And the new AHS show sits on my TiVo. Good grief…', 'Yeah, there’s always way too much stuff — so many things on my “I’ll watch that next” list that then get supplanted because something new comes out. And to think Disney are going to wade into this with their own streaming service with exclusive content! Ugh.', 'What Disney are doing could’ve massive. If they could launch a streaming service which had exclusivity of all Disney content (say it was the only place to see Marvel, Star Wars and Disney movies and TV shows). That would be seismic. Imagine if they then also ceased physical discs, if literally the only way to watch that stuff outside cinemas was that streaming service… They could name their own price. Scarier than anything in Stranger Things, I bet. And more of a dystopia than Blade Runner 2049.', 'Jeez, I hadn’t even thought of that. But I would not be at all surprised if that’s their intended endgame. Why license stuff to other platforms when you can keep it exclusive to your own? Why release physical media when you competition doesn’t? Plus they’re smart enough to know they can’t just do it instantly, so it’ll be a gradual shift over the next however-many years, so that people just accept it. And if anyone can pull it off its Disney — they’ve got both the money to weather it and the popularity of the content.', 'I think that’s why Netflix are getting into making movies and Amazon also investing heavily in content (Lord of the Rings TV show? Ker-ching!). The days of Sky, Virgin cable etc are possibly numbered- possibly even cinemas ultimately. Content is king. Why sell to distribution networks if you can distribute it yourself? I’m sure it’s many years away but things can move quicker than anyone expects.

The series reinforces some stereotypes, while others are made more complex.', 'NCIS is an offshoot of JAG, and, like its predecessor, it takes a military angle on the standard legal/crime procedural drama: The unit\'s purpose is to investigate crimes involving Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Mark Harmon plays Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, the man in charge of on-the-ground operations. Gibbs is a serious guy whose impatience with bureaucracy makes you wonder why he chose a career in the military, but whose experience and intensity keep the rest of the team on track. His two main investigators, Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) and Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), riff with each other constantly, including some sexual banter.

comedy "['Andy Samberg rose to fame on the tidal waves of his oft viral “SNL Digital Shorts”. Many of these were huge hits (Dick in a Box, I’m on a Boat, Lazy Sunday), and some were forgettable. In 2013, after SNL, Samberg became the featured player in FOX’s cop comedy Brooklyn 99. For an actor whose success had previously relied on short, quotable clips and songs gaining online popularity, Samberg’s current project has demonstrated a surprising quality: consistency.', 'Brooklyn 99 brings together creators Daniel Goor and Michael Schur, who combined, have been involved in many of the great TV comedies of the last decade. Goor is a longtime comedy writer, with lengthy stints on The Daily Show and Late Night with Conan O’Brien. \xa0Schur was a writer for both SNL and Parks and Rec. He also played Dwight Shrute’s enigmatic cousin Mose on The Office and did some writing there as well. With the backdrop of the NYPD’s 99th Precinct Goor and Schur have created a diverse and quirky cast that delivers plenty of laughs even with very little story. As a credit to the excellent writing, week to week Brooklyn 99 has been one of the most consistent comedies on TV, there never seems to be a dud episode.', 'In a cop drama the cases are the plot. You are supposed to care about who did it and whether justice is served, and the characters operate within that framework. In Brooklyn 99, a cop comedy, the cases are just something that is going on throughout the episode with very little reason for the viewer to care about if they catch the drug dealer or not. Minimizing the crime fighting aspect of the show allows the characters to interact more in the precinct, which is a much better way to deliver comedy than trying to make homicide funny week in and week out. But for viewers conditioned to 1-hour cop dramas (even lighthearted ones like Castle), the first few episodes of Brooklyn 99 that you watch may feel uncomfortable. “There’s no way the guy they just arrested did it! It’s too simple! There must be a plot twist coming!”. Nope, there isn’t (usually). It’s a 30-minute comedy. Adjust your zeal for seeing cop procedure accordingly.', 'Samberg’s character, Detective Jake Peralta, is not exactly an acting stretch for the SNL alum. Peralta is unabashedly juvenile, constantly sarcastic, and never takes anything seriously. It’s pretty much Samberg’s wheelhouse. He’s super comfortable in the role and it works well to have a character with such a serious occupation and the demeanor of a middle schooler. It would have been all too easy to have made the character of Jake Peralta out of the cool-cop-who’s-unfazed-by-everything mold. But Peralta is an endearing and almost vulnerable character who strives for the affections of his coworkers and boss, all the while comparing events happening around him to Die Hard, the reason he became a cop. It all works.', 'Peralta is joined in “The 99” by his partner and dedicated foodie Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio). The Boyle character can be cloying at times, but delivers enough weirdness (particularly related to his dad dating another cop’s mom) to make it worthwhile to have him around. Peralta’s childhood friend Gina Linetti (played by Chelsea Peretti) serves as the civilian administrative assistant for the precinct. Peretti brings a bizarre confidence to the glittery sweater-wearing, dance enthusiast, and self-declared cultural icon that is Gina. Terry Crews plays Sargent Terry Jeffords. Crews (of Old Spice commercial fame) isn’t exactly a comedy dynamo. But he’s serviceable, and his presence sets up lots of great drooling from Gina.', 'Other precinct inhabitants include the duo of Hitchcock and Scully (Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller). Michael Schur may have borrowed a move from his time at Parks and Rec by introducing not one, but two Jerry Gergich-esque characters into Brooklyn 99. Like Jerry, Hitchcock and Scully exist to be the brunt of everyone elses’ jokes and scorn. And they take it all without getting their feelings hurt so that you can feel comfortable laughing at them too! It’s a neat little comedy trick. Detectives Rosa Diaz and Amy Santiago (Stephanie Beatriz and Melissa Fumero) round out the crew (Brookyln 99 gets props for having a cast that’s made up of two-thirds Hispanic women, you don’t see that often). One weak point in the show is the romantic connection between Santiago and Peralta. While cute, it lacks any semblance of real spark. Jim and Pam they are not.', '“The 99” is supervised by Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher of The Wire). Holt is stone-faced, consummately professional, anti-fun, high-brow, gay, meticulous, and hilarious. Braugher’s dead pan delivery is impeccable and scene stealing. The reluctant (on Holt’s part) budding mentorship between Holt and Peralta is one of the better recurring themes of the show.', 'Now three seasons in, Brooklyn 99 is at a point where it might start to show its age soon. Through its junior year, the lighthearted cop comedy has been one of the most consistent, though not always adventuresome, sources of laughs on TV (certainly on network TV). Will they be able to maintain that consistency beyond their\xa0third year and move into the league of long-running great network comedies like 30 Rock, Parks and Rec, or Frasier? Or will the cop show setting finally start to feel more like a limitation than an inspiration for comedy? With the excellent cast and well developed characters we suspect it will be the former. This is a show with enough talent that we’d watch them just hand out parking tickets for a couple more seasons.']" "[' Comedy', ' Crime']" "Brooklyn Nine-Nine"

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', '\n\nRated R\nfor sequences of strong violence, drug content, language throughout and some sexual material.\n', 'The franchise-style espionage thriller has long been ripe for a sendup, or a pastiche, or an update, or whatever the hell people think it’s ripe for. The comic book “Kingsman” provided the basis for 2015’s “Kingsman: The Secret Service,” a blockbuster sized action picture with, ostensibly, a cheeky attitude not unlike that of “Kick-Ass” (also directed by Matthew Vaughn). For many, that movie filled the sendup/pastiche/update bill quite nicely. Instead of an official intelligence industry, the secret agent outfit Kingsman, operating out of a high-end tailor’s shop, is a privatized law-enforcement security service with a lot of high-tech weaponry and convoluted cutting-edge tech protocol. ', 'The movie itself, a sort of bildungsroman in which raw recruit Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is given a class-conscious catapult to lethal gentlemanhood by older agent Harry (Colin Firth), was sufficiently slick and energetic that you might not notice at first what a callous, nihilistic, smirky, sexist, retrograde pile of expensive garbage it was. It even managed to make its last-call anal sex joke seem mildly charming … if you didn’t think about it too much. ', 'The true tell in the first film was the character of Gazelle, a henchperson of the main villain, a woman whose prosthetic legs are sharp knife edges. With these she can amputate limbs, and even cut a man entirely in half. These mutilations were depicted in a sterile, near analgesic fashion; the audience is meant to titter at the loss of life and limb delivered so efficiently, with no pain, no mess. Similar dismemberments and body halvings are delivered in the sequel, “Kingsman: The Golden Circle.” It’s violence for cowardly voyeurs who want to make the people who annoy them just shut up in a way that’s silent, sterile, and thoroughly humiliating to the victim. ', 'But the movie was successful, so now there’s the sequel, cooked up in the script department by director Vaughn and Jane Goldman. If you think having a woman co-writing the screenplay will help in the egregious gross sexism department you are mistaken; one of this movie’s “gags” involves putting a tracker on a villain’s girlfriend by means of a form of sexual assault the current president of the United States once bragged about. Eggsy performs this act reluctantly, we are meant to understand, in part because he is now in a committed relationship with the Swedish Princess who gifted him with anal sex in the first movie. ', '“Kingsman: The Golden Circle,” which finds the British tailors decimated and forced to join forces with a whiskey manufacturing U.S. spy network called “Statesman” and featuring such personages as Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry, is even longer than the first movie, clocking in at two hours and 20 minutes or so. As action-packed as the movie is, it feels like it’s six hours. That’s in part because the pacing is so spavined; the movie lurches twitchily from set piece to set piece and spends inordinate amounts of time on shots of its sharp-dressed characters slow-motioning into the widescreen frames showing off accessories that will be sold to you by various companies in various Kingsman tie-ins all over the Internet. (A scene wherein Firth is packing up his things finds the actor taking special care to make sure the wooden Art of Shaving soap dish is turned to the camera lens. In recent weeks, I’ve received no less than a dozen e-mails from Art of Shaving, all tied in to “Kingsman.”)\xa0', 'It also feels long because every bit or joke is dragged out long past its funniness or shock value. The plot here, just as reactionary in its way as that of the first one, centers around a drug cartel, the Golden Circle, run out of a jungle presided over by Julianne Moore’s Poppy. (I hope the producers of this movie paid Moore an inordinate amount of money, because all she gives them in return for her fee is a passable Megan Mullally impersonation, which is still less than they deserve.) Poppy’s very rich and powerful but also isolated and lonely, so she’s kidnapped Elton John and is forcing him to perform solely for her. Elton John is played by himself. This is funny at first, then sour, then gets beaten worse than a dead horse as Sir Elton is made a plot point and a climactic action sequence is played out over one of his more raucous numbers. “Enough,” one thinks, but “enough” does not exist in the philosophy of this movie.', 'Well, I suppose it does in one respect. In “Kingsman: The Secret Service,” villain Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson, inveigled various world leaders into going along with his twisted save-the-earth doomsday scheme; he then implanted a device in their necks that, unbeknownst to them, could blow up their heads if triggered. One of the world leaders was meant to be taken for then-President Barack Obama. And at the movie’s ending, all the head-exploding devices were made to go off, and the audience was invited to guffaw at the spectacle of Barack Obama’s head blowing up. This movie’s plot hinges on tainted drugs that will kill, potentially, all the world’s substance abusers. The scheme, initiated by Moore’s character, is reported by Fox News, none of whose correspondents are shown to have the sign of the taint. Because no one who works for Fox News does drugs, as we know. This movie also features a United States President, but not a real one, as the last film did; this movie’s president is white, and played by Bruce Greenwood. It’s probably just a coincidence that this movie is produced by Fox. It probably means nothing that this movie, made by people who invited you to laugh at the violent death of the United States’ first black president, won’t touch Donald Trump with a ten-foot pole. They can’t be racist, right? They cast Halle Berry in this movie and Samuel L. Jackson in the last. They approve of black actors at least.

Both shows can only legitimately claim to be “inspired by” by the Douglas Adams work, and that’s probably the only way to get something that works. Adams’ writing is too specific to the medium, and largely far too “internal” to adapt in a direct way.', 'In the latest show, that means that there is actually little in common with the book series in terms of the actual plot, though there is still a Dirk Gently (Samuel Barnett – Penny Dreadful), who is still a “holistic” detective, and there is still a poor schlub who finds himself at the heart of a crazy investigation. Todd (Elijah Wood), said schlub, works in a hotel, and has a crazy landlord, but generally leads a pretty boring life. One day, his crazy landlord decides to beat the hell out of his car, and once he makes it to work, he discovers a brutal, and bizarre crime scene.', 'Just when things can’t get weirder, Dirk Gently shows up to tell Todd that strange things are afoot, and that he’s a holistic detective, which seems to mean that Todd has stepped in it. A holistic detective, by the way, apparently being someone who solves crimes/cases simply by being astoundingly in tune with the interconnectedness of all things.', 'Now, Todd has to stay clear of the police, who have a lot of questions for him, pay for his sister’s expensive medication, despite having absolutely no money, and keep from getting killed merely by proximity to Gently, who doesn’t even know that a holistic assassin is after him.', 'While the show obviously doesn’t aim for a direct telling of Douglas Adams, it is so in line with the spirit and ability of his series that it becomes rather frightening. It isn’t just the oddball levity of a situation that is nonsensical, or the effort at charm and borderline disinterest of our hero, but the entire tone and the most subtle of moments.', 'There’s a reason that filming things by Adams has something like “humorously reminiscent” as the top bar, and that is because so much of it can’t be filmed, because it doesn’t exist in the world. Not in the unimportant “there’s no spaceship to film on,” sense that is easy to overcome, but because things like “Zaphod Beeblebrox-y” isn’t an actual quality that you can hope to have an actor pretend to have.', 'Nevertheless, Barnett is surprising in the role of Gently, but more importantly, Wood embodies the entire series of novels and its entire, hysterical mood of being adrift on senseless currents. The two together remind of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry in Jeeves & Wooster. That’s a tricky comparison, and it isn’t that I mean to say they are as good, in some objective sense, but they similar tackle impossible characters, and it becomes as though the author had them in mind. It is also at least a similar style of British buffoonery at play.', 'All that said, the show reels you in like Adams at his best, almost daring you to turn away, and there’s something of a sideways shot at the air of superiority that has become too common in American “plot-twisty” efforts.', 'The tangential stories that influence, or try to influence, events aren’t quite given the attention they deserve through the first episode, but there are a lot of balls in the air here, and a little expediency is forgivable.', 'Sadly, like all of Adams’ works, and therefore those inspired by them, there’s no real way to relay the meat of the matter. When you ask someone if they’ve read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and they say, “No, what’s it about?” you’re rather stuck.

comedy "['A slightly earlier than normal TV review this month, to get ahead of all the Christmas telly — but there’s still plenty to discuss…', 'The Punisher \xa0Season 1\nThe fourth live-action iteration of Frank Castle, Marvel’s murderous anti-hero (and people moan about Spider-Man reboots), debuted in Daredevil season two and was greeted so positively that now he’s got his own spin-off series. And “spin-off” is not an inaccurate descriptor, because this very much launches out of the events of Frank’s storyline in Daredevil — which makes it all the more annoying that Netflix care not for “previously on”s: Daredevil season two was over 18 months ago; a little refresher would be nice.', 'You see, the plot revisits the Punisher’s origins: his family were killed in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out, leading him to kill the criminals responsible. He thinks that mission is complete, but the season begins (more or less) with him discovering new intel that suggests his family’s murder may not have been so random, and it links back to his actions when he was in the military. This also serves as a launchpad for the series to tackle other war-related issues, primarily the psychological wellbeing of veterans. With such serious themes it’s perhaps no surprise that there’s very little here that’s outright comic-book-y here — no superpowers, for sure; not even veiled references to the big names of the MCU movies, which we’ve had in every other Marvel Netflix show. In fact, if it weren’t for the fact the series is so obviously spun out of Daredevil and has the Marvel logo at the start, you could be forgiven for thinking it wasn’t a Marvel show at all.', 'Some people think this removes the Punisher’s USP. In and of himself he’s just a violent man out for revenge — action cinema is stuffed to bursting with such anti-heroes. What makes Frank unique is he’s that kind of character but in a world where super-powered and super-moral people exist. So would The Punisher have been more interesting if, instead of a very grounded military conspiracy storyline, it had something to do with Frank clashing with superpowered people? I don’t know. It certainly would’ve been a different show. As it stands, this may be a show for people who don’t typically like Marvel shows. So was Jessica Jones before it, but this is for different people who don’t like Marvel shows — people like Jason Statham, maybe.', 'In the title role, Jon Bernthal is fantastic. You can absolutely believe him as a revenge-driven psychopath capable of killing anyone and everyone, but also as a kind-of-charming strong-but-silent type with a heart and moral code who will definitely do the right thing. I’ve seen some critics and viewers opine that now is the wrong time for a series about a hero who just murders indiscriminately. I say those people definitely haven’t watched this Punisher. Although the plot is a conspiracy thriller, the series invests a lot of time in the emotional world of Frank Castle, making him human and moral rather than just a single-minded murder-machine. Bernthal makes what could be a very one-note role into a plausible human being; one who you believe might be able to find redemption and leave someday. And maybe that makes him even more tragic — he could find it; it’s possible… but likely? There’s the rub. As it’s also trying to engage with issues facing combat veterans once they return home, it makes for a clearly different, more serious flavour for an MCU production. How successfully it explores these weighty issues is more debatable.', 'Many of these Marvel shows take their whole first season to fully complete the hero’s origin story, but The Punisher is stuck with the fact that Castle already became The Punisher during his Daredevil appearance. So do they just ignore that story shape? No, of course they don’t — they shift it on to the villain! Therefore any comic book fan who knows what one character will ultimately become (no spoilers here!) is constantly teased with possibilities throughout the season until, eventually, as we should’ve known from the start, the transformation occurs in the finale. Why not really surprise us: do the transformation earlier and then wrap a character up within one season, rather than leaving them dangling for a possible next time? Comic books have to leave things dangling — they will all run for ever and ever; there can be no permanent solutions — but these TV series will end — whether it’s after a single season, or two, or five, or ten, they are without exception finite. That means you’re allowed to wrap a character up and move on to others.', 'So, The Punisher is not an unmitigated success, but it does lend another flavour to the Marvel-Netflix landscape. I certainly hope we get to see more of Bernthal’s take on the character in the future.', 'Detectorists \xa0Series 3 Episodes 2-6\nThe third and final series of BBC Four’s sitcom about a couple of mates whose hobby is metal detecting was every bit the equal of the first two runs, which saw the show place on my list of 10 Favourite TV Series of the Last 10 Years back in February. Its brilliance lies in how perfectly weighted it is: the characters are quirky, but also normal; their problems are grounded and realistic, without being glum and unduly serious; it’s frequently hilarious, but without slipping into gurning ‘Comedy’ territory; it’s kind and gentle, but without being dull; and it’s all very lovely and kind-hearted, without being twee or saccharine. It’s also beautifully put together by writer-director (and star) Mackenzie Crook — the storyline across the series was precisely constructed, and the photography is often a gorgeous showcase for the English countryside. A real gem that will be missed, though at least it came to a perfect conclusion.', 'The Good Place \xa0Season 1 Episodes 3-13\nI only heard about this after its Big Twist was much-discussed online, so starting it was an exercise in knowing there was a big reveal awaiting. Fortunately, that knowledge doesn’t overshadow everything that comes before it. For those who still aren’t aware of it (especially as it’s only on Netflix on this side of the pond), it’s about a woman (Kristen Bell) who dies and goes to Heaven only due to an admin error, so she tries to better herself so that she’s deserving of her place. Other complications emerge as the season goes on, but that’s the premise. There’s a lot of plot for a sitcom — although it’s not necessarily immediately obvious, it tells a 13-episode story; this makes Netflix quite a natural home for it, actually, as it’s not your typical “every episode is fundamentally standalone” sitcom. But it’s also very funny in amongst all that, mining not only the characters and their foibles, but also the uncommon situation they’ve found themselves in. The shocker in the finale is just the icing on the cake. I hear season two has gone off the boil somewhat, but I’ll find out for myself once it’s all wrapped up.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have been missing so much stuff.

What the world needs now is Ferdinand, sweet Ferdinand, a rare breed of bovine who takes a stand against aggression, competitive rivalry and conforming to the expectations of others. ', 'Alas, the box-office force will be with “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” this weekend, while audiences will likely continue to be loco for “Coco,” Pixar’s tribute to Mexican culture. Hence, one must admire whoever had the cajones to release this pacifist-leaning animated fable based on a beloved 1936 children’s picture-book about a “toro” whose muscular build belies his soulful nature. Instead of locking horns with other bulls or dodging a matador’s red cape, Ferdinand would rather stop and smell the posies—especially the red ones. As he asks his father, “Can I be the champion of not fighting?”', 'Fox’s ‘toon factory Blue Sky is often more of a stealth player when it comes to touting its family films as opposed to the chest thumping that Disney and DreamWorks embrace. But lowered expectations aren’t a bad thing at times. That is why “Ferdinand” comes as a mostly pleasant surprise in a year that has produced a lack of stellar animated outings and stands in stark contrast to less savory aspects of “The Boss Baby” and “The LEGO Batman Movie.” Yes, there is padding afoot in the plotting, including a group dance-off, a too-long chase through a crowded city as well as an excess of chatty critters. But instead of being crude and rude, director Carlos Saldanha—a veteran of the “Ice Age” franchise whose “Rio” films were love letters to his native Brazil—and his writing team chose to extol such virtues as respect for others, teamwork, kindness and following your dream even if you are being coerced to do otherwise. ', 'When we first meet Ferdinand as a calf, he doesn’t join in the macho games and trash talk enjoyed by his corral companions. He’d rather nurture a pretty carnation that has sprouted in their training pen than brag about his future prowess in the ring. But when his father fails to return after being picked to face a matador, Ferdinand runs away and finds himself on a farm awash in fragrant buds and becomes a pet to Nina, a young girl who lives there with her dad. As in the source material, Ferdinand grows to immense proportions yet maintains his docile nature. But a run-in with a bee causes him to become atypically ferocious and he is sent back to train with his old buddies. ', 'He is assigned a wonky-toothed, googly-eyed calming goat named Lupe (Kate McKinnon, a stitch in hyper sidekick mode) who coaches the grown-up Ferdinand (infectiously voiced by wrestling superstar John Cena) in the art of the fight. But her heavyweight contender has no interest in charging at a red cape, especially after he figures out that a bull either ends up going to the “chop shop”—a rather terrifying meat factory that is bluntly dealt with—or is sacrificed for the sake of blood sport in the ring. It’s the opposite of a win-win. But that doesn’t prevent Ferdinand from being selected as a worthy opponent by the revered matador El Primero (Miguel Angel Silvestre) for his farewell appearance in the arena and puts his resistance to the test.\xa0\xa0 ', 'There are some clever sequences that make the most out Ferdinand’s considerable girth and natural grace, including one that capitalizes on the cliché “bull in a china shop” with nifty choreographed slapstick that wouldn’t be out of place in a W.C. Fields comedy from the ‘40s. Though it is brief, I was charmed by a sight gag where Ferdinand accidentally gets a caterpillar stuck in his nose and quickly sneezes it out in the form of a beautiful butterfly. While Nina’s shaggy dog Paco doesn’t quite get how he and Ferdinand can be brothers, as the bull claims, his wagging tail is an endearing tell that he obviously agrees. And while their presence in the movie is seemingly superfluous, there is a trio of vain mane-tossing Lipizzaners in the next field who try to outdo the other animals with their prance moves. When their exhausted leader, Hans (German comic Flula Borg), flops to the ground, I admit to laughing when he declares, “I’ve fallen—and I can’t giddy-up.” ', 'I also admired whoever chose such an eclectic quartet of actors to speak for Ferdinand’s bullring buddies: Bobby Cannavale as brutish Valiente, Anthony Anderson as skinny Bones, football legend Peyton Manning as skittish Guapo and David Tennant of “Doctor Who” fame as Angus, who hails from the Scottish highlands. But what is truly amazing about this film is how thoughtfully “Ferdinand” questions male gender expectations, considering the form of the message also showcases a trio of goofy hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs) and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias).

What\'s being shown\xa0in this film that couldn\'t also be expressed\xa0in prose?\xa0', 'In telling the true story of American airplane pilot\xa0Barry Seal (Tom Cruise), writer Gary Spinelli and director Doug Liman (""Edge of\xa0Tomorrow,"" ""Jumper"") choose to overstimulate\xa0viewers rather than challenge them. They emphasize Barry\'s charm, the exotic nature of his South American trade routes, and the rapid escalation of\xa0events that ultimately led to his downfall. Cruise\'s smile is, in this context, deployed like a weapon in Liman and Spinelli\'s overwhelming charm offensive. You don\'t get a lot of psychological insight into Barry\'s character, or\xa0learn why he was so determined to make more money than he could spend, despite conflicting\xa0pressures from Pablo Escobar\'s drug cartel and the American government to either quit or collude. ', 'But you do get a lot of shots of Cruise grinning from behind aviator glasses\xa0in extreme close-ups, many of which are lensed with hand-held digital cameras that show you the wilds of Nicaragua and Colombia through an Instagram-cheap green/yellow filter.

But it\'s mostly\xa0a sensational, sub-""Wolf of Wall Street""-style true crime story that attempts to seduce you, then abandon you.', 'The alarming pace of\xa0Barry\'s narrative, designed to put Cruise’s charisma front and center, keeps viewers disoriented. It\'s often hard to understand Barry\'s motives\xa0beyond caricature-broad assumptions about his (lack of) character.

There\'s character-defining insanity, and then there\'s ""this barely makes\xa0sense in the moment when it is happening"" crazy. Barry often appears to be the latter kind of nutbar.', 'There are\xa0two types of people in ""American Made"": the kind that work and the kind that get worked over. It\'s easy to tell the two apart based on how much screen-time Spinelli and Liman devote to each character. Schafer, for example, is defined by the taunts he suffers\xa0from a fellow\xa0cubicle drone and his own\xa0tendency to over-promise. Schafer doesn\'t do real work—not in the filmmakers\' eyes.\xa0The same is true of Escobar and his fellow dealers, who are treated as lawless salesmen of an unsavory product.\xa0And don\'t get me started on JB (Caleb Landry Jones), Lucy\'s lazy, Gremlin-driving, under-age-girl-dating, Confederate-flag-waving redneck brother.', ""But what about Lucy? She keeps Barry's family together, but\xa0her feelings are often taken for granted, even when\xa0she\xa0calls Barry out for abandoning her suddenly in order to meet up with Schafer. Barry responds by throwing bundles of cash at his wife's feet. The argument, and the scene end just like that, like a smug joke whose punchline might as well be,\xa0There's no problem that\xa0a ton of cash can't solve."", '""American Made"" sells a toxic, shallow, anti-American Dream bill of goods for anybody looking to shake their head about\xa0exceptionalism without seriously considering what conditions enable that mentality.\xa0Spinelli and Liman don\'t say anything except,\xa0Look at how far a determined charmer can go if he\'s greedy and determined enough. They respect Barry too much to be thoughtfully critical of him. And they barely disguise their\xa0fascination with\xa0broad jokes that\xa0tease Barry\'s team of hard-working good ol\' boys and put down\xa0everyone else.', 'Sure, it\'s important to note that Barry ultimately meets a just end, one that\'s been prescribed to thousands of other would-be movie\xa0gangsters.

He’s tall, brawny and impossibly handsome, but there’s a self-mocking twinkle in his eye. When Thor is in gung-ho jock mode, Hemsworth’s wry machismo evokes the young Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an eyebrow at the corniness around him. When he bumbles and stumbles, there’s a touch of Cary Grant to his embarrassment. And when he’s playing things more or less straight, there’s an average guyness to his reactions. All this humanizes an actor who’s perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.\xa0   "", 'Hemsworth’s charisma holds “Thor: Ragnarok” together whenever it threatens to spin apart, which unfortunately is often. Written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and directed by Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), this is almost but not quite a stand-alone picture, tethered to previous “Avengers” entries only by Thor’s opening search for the Infinity Stones, which has led him to be imprisoned by the fire demon Sutur. The demon tells him that his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard and that their homeworld will soon be destroyed in Ragnarok, a prophesied apocalypse. After that, the film splits into a couple of parallel narratives.\xa0   ', 'Fully half the film is a court intrigue/war picture, charting the takeover of Asgard by Thor’s long lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), a black-clad force of nature who seems to turn into a demonic stag-beast when she fights: her head sprouts elegant antlers that might have been sketched in the air with a brush dipped in India ink. The other “Thor: Ragnarok” is a largely comedic gladiator movie with prison thriller accents: Thor is trapped on the planet Sakaar, where he’s forced to fight the planet’s reigning champion, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). As revealed in trailers, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is back, too—and why wouldn’t he be? He’s easily the most entertaining villain, or antihero, in the franchise, so beguiling that when Thor inevitably succumbs to his charisma and fights alongside him, both he and the audience momentarily forget how much death and property destruction he’s caused in prior chapters.\xa0   ', 'The overqualified supporting cast does a lot with not-quite enough. Sakaar’s “Grandmaster” is Jeff Goldblum, who gives exactly the sort of performance you’d want Jeff Goldblum to give in a project like this: intellectually detached, droll and smart-alecky, yet also somehow petty, arbitrary and sadistic. Goldblum\'s unique genius is his ability to toss off lines that might\'ve seemed as overripe as week-old avocados on the page, like, ""Let\'s have a hand for all of our undercard competitors who died so gruesomely."" (From the inventive way he adds ""ums"" and ""ahhs,"" you can tell that he\'s also a jazz musician.)\xa0The worst thing I can say about him is that he’s more appealing here than well-used. Either there should have been a lot more of him—though not at the expense of Blanchett, who’s a slinky hoot—or his efforts should’ve been more finely shaped by the filmmakers, so that his brilliance cohered into a bona fide character or else pushed on towards toward Dadaist madness, like Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N. Furter in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or the late Gene Wilder’s title performance in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.” (The latter seems to have been what Waititi and company were going for in casting Goldblum: when Thor is introduced to Sakaar, “Pure Imagination” plays on the soundtrack.)\xa0   ', ""As Valkyrie, an alcoholic bounty hunter who once fought against Hela and now works for The Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson more than holds her own in scenes opposite Hiddleston, Hemsworth and Ruffalo. She's hard-boiled, like a tough dame in a 1940s detective film spitting wisecracks. As Skurge, a warrior who survives Hela’s destructive takeover of Asgard and joins her in order to survive, “Lord of the Rings” star Karl Urban captures the unhappiness of a\xa0 sellout who knows he’s better than the life he’s expediently chosen; but so much of his performance is reduced to anguished reaction shots that you may wonder—as you might with Thompson—whether the best bits got cut for pacing.\xa0   "", ""In the run-up to release, much was made of the allegedly drastic shift in tone that would make this project unique. It was sold as a light, funky, largely comedic effort—practically a spoof of Marvel’s usual, with Thor and the Hulk serving as the anchor of, basically, a buddy movie, like the kind\xa0 Bob Hope and Bing Crosby used to churn out. There are times when it gets close to that promised film, and when it hits pay dirt, it is delightful—particularly during very broad slapstick moments, as when Hulk enters the arena and Thor laughs with relief and announces, “I know him—he's a friend from work!”; and in moments of relatively subdued character development, as when Thor and Hulk commiserate in private and we learn that the big green guy loves it on Sakaar because the people treat him as an athletic superstar and folk hero, in contrast to the pariah treatment he gets back on Earth. (When you’re mainly good at Hulk Smash, it’s a relief to land a job that asks you to do nothing but.)   \xa0   "", 'When Hulk turns back into Bruce Banner, Ruffalo reminds us that he’s giving two performances here, both superb. He revels in the looming physicality of Hulk—a motion capture performance on par with Andy Serkis’ best—but when he turns back into a regular man, he seems to shrink within himself. He’s unafraid to use his shortness for laughs, appearing side-by-side against the towering Hemsworth in wide shots like the superhero answer to Laurel and Hardy. Banner’s complaints are small, too—and yet they aren’t, because of their recognizable humanity: “You’re just using me to get to Hulk,” he whines. “It’s gross. You’re a bad friend.”   \xa0   ', ""Unfortunately, as is often the case with Marvel films, the adventurous aspects aren’t adventurous enough, and the more predictable aspects—the CGI-saturated fight scenes, with bodies whirling through the air; the wide shots of cities burning and giant creatures on the rampage; the images of whooshing, twisting star gates and bodies falling from the sky like meteors—are more frenzied and loud than inspired, and eventually become monotonous. The movie's final third, yet another Marvel Big Battle, is as tedious as the first two-thirds are endearing. There's a whiff of post-colonialist critique in the presentation of Asgard as an empire that was founded on war but that now hypocritically congratulates itself for being peaceful,  but the screenplay doesn't develop the idea as well as it might. A climactic twist, which I won’t reveal here, is presented in such a tonally inappropriate way that it calls the film’s entire approach into question. (“Ant-Man”’s status as the best off-brand MCU film remains unchallenged.) Only the comic chemistry of the main quadrangle—Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Thompson and Ruffalo—prevents “Thor: Ragnarok” from devolving into another standard-issue superhero crash-and-bash fest.Still, there’s plenty to like here. Waititi, his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (“Blue Jasmine”), and his production designer Dan Hennah take their cues from pop art-influenced comic book adaptations of the ‘60s and ‘70s, like TV’s “Batman,” “Logan’s Run,” “Flash Gordon” and “The Black Hole,” filling the screen with kitschy costumes, furniture, artifacts and machinery envisioned in the tiled, knobby style of the late, great illustrator Jack Kirby, and presenting it all in oversaturated color. The disco-drug-trip gaudiness is a welcome change of pace from superhero cinema’s default bled-by-leeches look. At one point, Thor gripes about the red-and-white patterning of the capital city's interiors, as well he should: they’re hideous. Mark Mothersbaugh, the onetime Devo co-founder and composer who scored four Wes Anderson films, creates a retro-synth soundtrack suited to the era of science fiction cinema in which characters wore jumpsuits. This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren’t devastating. I’d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime.\xa0"", 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

One of the more straight-up comedies of the fest, “The Polka King” treats viewers to a bizarre true story and funky performances from its strong cast.', 'The movie is like a goof on the American Dream a la Michael Bay’s “Pain & Gain,” but with the small-town-version scheming of a “The Wolf of Wall Street.” The dreamer in this case is Polish immigrant/polka bandleader Jan Lewan (Jack Black), who has pride, perhaps too much pride (not plainly ego) about being successful. He also has a certain naivete, both to the way that government works and his stern belief if he can think things, they will come true. At the beginning of the film, he leads a rollicking polka band that goes by his name, and owns a shop in a strip mall in Hazelton, PA that sells various Polish trinkets. We also see in a cartoonishly-cut flashback that he works various other jobs, washing bathrooms, cleaning dishes or delivering pizzas, indicating a sweet, sincere hustle.\xa0', ""Jan's dream of making more money and having an empire of Polish and polka-based goods leads him to giving promissory notes to his polka group fans, thinking it's an easy way to make money. He’s informed steadily that this is a ponzi scheme, that it must cease immediately, and that he has to pay back his investors. But when a sweet older couple say they want to invest even more money, Jan gives in, and takes the money. For years, he isn’t investigated, and his business ventures (a trip that promises a pope meeting, for one) get crazier and crazier. “This Really Happened” is the first line of text in the story, and feels like the refrain to the various absurd sequences that follow.\xa0"", 'The story cuts corners with the seriousness of the events, opting to highlight the absurd details of Jan\'s con work, however naive he may truly be. Jack Black’s incredible, passionate performance is a key bonding agent to the script, in which he is able to make Jan vividly likable, innocent, hilarious and tragic, often simultaneously. You see the gears of choosing greed turn in Black’s head when one bad decision leads to a clumsier one, even if the movie doesn’t paint a full picture of all the businesses that he owns, or why he thinks he won\'t be caught. From the beginning he makes this a passionate venture along the likes of his work in “Bernie,” taking on a thick Polish accent while boasting an incredible singing voice and fantastic range. (There\'s a show-stopping scene where he sings ""Proud to be an American"" with his Polish band, which is both hilarious and chilling.) The movie repeats the message that “Bernie” sent as well, that as narratives try to cover so much territory but with a constant human anchor, Black is one of the very best for the job. With the precision of his performance and the bigness of his presence, he is able to find the empathy that allow us to connect and laugh with strange characters.\xa0', 'As Jan’s business leads to wilder sequences, “The Polka King” boasts supporting performances that match the craziness and equally surprise. Jenny Slate gives one of her best performances yet as the wife of Jan, who has her own interest in the spotlight and success, a great riff on the Melania Trumps of the world. Jason Schwartzman brings back some of the dryness most found in his Wes Anderson days, this time playing the polka band clarinet player who is a sidekick of sorts to Jan, but is also left in the dark. Of everyone though, possibly even Black, the biggest performance belongs to Jacki Weaver, who plays perfectly to the slightly elevated reality by being like a Simpsons character brought to life (Patti or Selma come to mind) as Jan’s antagonistic mother-in-law.\xa0', 'From co-writer/director Maya Forbes and writer Wally Wolodarsky, the movie is also able to actualize an elevated cartoonish reality for the story, starting with its excellent, gaudy production design (like the strip mall that the gift shop is located on) and editing that tells the story with sharp timing and zippy jokes. (The movie is a treasure trove of goofy physical actions by its characters.) It’s a major film for Forbes, who found the funny material within her tense personal family tale of “Infinitely Polar Bear,” but now proves she can orchestrate unique, massive comedy, especially when working with such an excellent cast.\xa0', 'It’s not a spoiler, but Jan Lewan was indeed at the screening last night, and (after climbing onto the stage himself) was able to clarify just how authentic the movie’s events are: “pretty much true.” Afterward, he and Black performed a polka rap (you’ll see soon, I’m sure), basking in massive applause. As someone near me asked, “Doesn’t he owe people five million dollars? Are we OK with that?” That’s a revealing observation to the slightness this movie has with the legitimately bad things Jan did. But the movie is very often fruitful with its goofiness. ""The Polka King"" finds a distinct balance of being good-spirited to the title person while able to let us laugh out loud about his absurdities.\xa0', '\nNext Article: Sundance 2017: ""Beatriz at Dinner,"" ""Wilson""\nPrevious Article: Sundance 2017: ""Novitiate,"" ""Colossal,"" ""Bitch""\n', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

comedy "['FOX‘s new comedy, New Girl, is a dangerous enterprise, and it isn’t helped by the fact that the line-up is going to change right after the pilot. It’s dangerous, because it’s a very particular brand of comedy, and one that is hard to categorize without using the word “silly.” That may or may not make for a successful show, but it’s a trickier gamble than most comedy offerings. At least, today.', 'There was a time when silly was all but the name of the game, and whether it was Ted Baxter, or Jack Tripper, the key descriptor of most comedy characters on television was “goofy.” That’s not today’s game, for good or ill, and the shows that make it are largely after quotes for their commercials that run along the lines of “clever,” “witty,” or at least, “laugh out loud funny.” Silly, even in its heyday, was rarely laugh out loud funny.', 'Of course, this is updated silliness, but making it through the antics of Zooey Deschanel‘s character, Jess, even in the pilot alone, without raising your eyebrows and thinking of her as little more than a kooky, goofy, silly anti-stereotype is a chore. I say “anti-stereotype,” because though her character is delivered in the fashion of an overused stock character, she has too many things going on to be an actual stereotype.', 'Her uber-sensitive, severely awkward nerd girl may be a mashing together of the simplistic views of many types, but eventually complexity of character wins out over the stereotype game. Maybe.', 'The difficulty lies in the fact that none of this is actually a bad thing. That’s obviously tricky, because it sure seems like it is, especially to today’s markets. You don’t hear a lot of chatter around the water-cooler about the great new show that everyone loves because it’s really silly.', 'In a nutshell, Jess finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her, and answers an ad for a roommate. The available room is in a loft apartment with three guys: Nick (Jake Johnson), a prickly bartender, Schmidt (Max Greenfield) a womanizer of sorts, and Coach (Damon Wayans, Jr.) a personal trainer. (Note – Due to the late pick-up of Wayans’ other show Happy Endings, Lamorne Morris joins the show after the pilot as Winston, when he returns from playing basketball in Latvia and takes back the room he was subletting to Coach)', 'The guys aren’t particularly interested in Jess becoming a regular part of their lives, until she mentions that all her friends are models. Even with that nugget, they aren’t all on board with the pro-con layout of the idea. Things go from bad to worse when, after moving in, Jess makes good on her threat to watch Dirty Dancing virtually non-stop for the foreseeable future. Finally, they decide they’re going to have to make the best of it, and if that’s going to go anywhere, they’re going to need to snap Jess out of her depression. Of course, getting back on the horse is a great idea, but it still involves some level of coordination, and putting Jess back into life sounds easy, but its an uphill struggle with her “adorkable” charm being a tough sell to the uninitiated.', 'The previews spell things out rather well, with Jess’ Stooge-esque “wonka wonka” personality displays making life difficult for a group of guys who are trying to shape her up to be back on the market. She’s a handful, and adorable quirkiness can trip over into irritating pretty quickly, but in the end, she’s so much character that the very manly men (and the audience) can’t help but fall for her.', 'Not only does the show make a play for updating how silly and zany play out in a show, balanced by the fairly “normal” guys who, even with a three-to-one advantage, can hardly cope, it also showcases a certain “nerd appeal” that has slowly taken over the culture for the last several years. Nerd girl is the new black, and like a sort of mashing of Felicia Day, Casey McKinnon, Cali Lewis, and Veronica Belmont, plus massive doses of “girlie-ness” (read: crying all over the place), Liz has at least one demographic of viewer wrapped up at the outset. Of course, that’s largely because Zooey Deschanel could have just as easily been part of that list.', 'The real question the show raises is, how quickly can people become enamored with such a beast these days? The pilot, while not exactly hilarious, is a lot of fun, and better put together than many comedy offerings, but this is the kind of show that probably needs a lot of establishment before viewers really fall in love with it. At least, that’s the objective outlook. I love the show in a kind of theoretical sense, but I need to know how things are going to play for the next several episodes before it moves past a fun, entertaining lark, into the realm of that which I am definitely not missing every week. That shouldn’t be seen as a negative really. It’s just that kind of show.', 'I hope it takes off, because I’d like to see how the show explores the male/female interplay it has in its arsenal, but we have to face the fact that this is a rough road. If this were on cable, I’d pretty confidently tell you to go ahead and commit now, because this is going to become one of your favorite shows. The hard truth is that the world of shows that need to run a while before they really get their hooks into you is a world that has a hell of a time making it on big network television anymore. A lot of your favorite wacky comedies from the past only had to compete with two other channels, and you could develop the relationship with your audience in a richer way.', 'All that said, there is no show coming this fall that I hope will succeed more than New Girl. It is wickedly fun, and takes on its characters with reckless abandon. Unfortunately, much of that hope stems from the fact that there are few shows that are a bigger question mark in the grand scheme of things. Here’s to hoping that a lot of people out there are willing to embrace their inner awkwardness, and follow the adventures of a character who could turn into the New It Girl for a new generation.', 'NEW GIRL, the new comedy series from executive producer and writer Liz Meriwether (“No Strings Attached”) and starring Zooey Deschanel (“(500) Days of Summer”), will be the first broadcast network series to offer its debut episode on iTunes prior to its televised premiere. The episode will be available for free on iTunes (www.itunes.com) from today until Monday, Sept. 19. NEW GIRL premieres the following day, Tuesday, Sept. 20 (9:00-9:30 PM ET/PT), on FOX.', 'In the debut episode, JESS DAY (Deschanel) discovers her long-term boyfriend is cheating on her and decides to move into a loft apartment with three male roommates – prickly bartender NICK (Jake Johnson), womanizer SCHMIDT (Max Greenfield) and intense personal trainer COACH (guest-star Damon Wayans, Jr.). The guys, alongside Jess’ childhood best friend CECE (Hannah Simone), try to help Jess get back on her feet and into the dating world.', 'NEW GIRL is produced by Chernin Entertainment in association with 20th Century Fox Television. The series is created and written by Liz Meriwether. Meriwether, Jake Kasdan (“Bad Teacher”), Peter Chernin (TERRA NOVA), Katherine Pope (TERRA NOVA), Dave Finkel (“United States of Tara,” “30 Rock”) and Brett Baer (“United States of Tara,” “30 Rock”) are executive producers.

A witty, thrilling US women’s prison drama based on Piper Kerman’s memoir Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison, OITNB not only passed the Bechdel test but wore its intersectional feminist heart tattooed brightly on sleeve, creator and executive producer Jenji Kohan helming a crew and cast more intentionally diverse than anything preceding it.', 'A number of critics complained that framing a series featuring so many women of colour through the lens of thin, white, middle-class protagonist Piper Chapman (played with commendably doe-eyed comedic timing by Taylor Schilling) undermined its gains. Writer Aura Bogado went so far as to call this a modern-day slave narrative for the internet age. But three series in, it’s clear that Piper – doing time in low-security clink Litchfield for a decade-old drug-trafficking offence exposed by ex-girlfriend and fellow inmate Alex Vause\xa0(Laura Prepon) – is the Trojan Horse Kohan promised us from the get-go:', '“You’re not going to go into a network and sell a show on really fascinating tales of black women, and Latina women, and old women and criminals. But if you take this white girl, this sort of fish out of water, and you follow her in, you can then expand your world and tell all of those other stories. But it’s a hard sell to just go in and try to sell those stories initially. The girl next door, the cool blonde, is a very easy access point, and it’s relatable for a lot of audiences and a lot of networks looking for a certain demographic. It’s useful.”', 'Piper is more than a Trojan Horse, though – she’s a totem of white privilege, and Kohan invites us to relish the flogging she receives at Litchfield’s violent, dilapidated, bug-infested bedlam. Spa dates are replaced with grim communal showers, normcore clothes with prison-issue jumpsuit and the fledgling artisanal bath-product business she had pre-prison with the contraband and commissary pap that make up Litchfield’s internal currency.', 'Kohan’s adept at this study of self-absorbed bougie woman in criminal freefall after steering long-running Showtime series Weeds, which chronicled the exploits of housewife-turned-pot-kingpin Nancy Botwin. The same wry, shank-sharp wit is at work here, lacing the frequently dark prison plotlines – rape, menopause, addiction, gang violence – with expertly weighted humour; if we root for Chapman’s lost rich girl, it’s because, like model Rachel Robert’s trophy blonde in Rihanna’s Bitch Better Have My Money video, she’s the epitome of self-absorbed affluence; watching her cut down to size by the women her privilege had sheltered her from is deliciously gratifying.', 'Unlike Roberts, Piper offers a more complex antihero. As her clueless, country-club deb scrambles to navigate Litchfield’s fraught, high-stake rules (official and unofficial) and find her place among the mostly race-aligned cliques, we marvel at her naivety, her hardwired sense of entitlement as the system slowly breaks her down.', 'Kohan works plenty of comedy mileage out of Piper’s haplessness throughout season one, but it’s also in the trouble that fecklessness produces that the promise of growth – a kind of reverse rehabilitation – manifests itself. It’s only when she accidentally insults Galina ‘Red’ Reznikov, the magnificently august Russian-American matriarch played by Kate Mulgrew (late of Star Trek’s USS Voyager), that Piper truly realises her predicament; all that polite, intellectual New England charm – so effective on the outside – is redundant here among the criminals and psychopaths. Forced to employ a combination of humility, moxie and sacrifice, she ends up procuring then chewing a pile of hot chilies to produce a DIY-style Deep Heat balm for Red’s arthritic back – a reprieve-worthy gambit.', 'As Litchfield sands off her soft edges, Piper’s character evolves. When a troupe of delinquent teens are brought in for a tour of Litchfield towards the end of season one, it is her – not the stereotype-aping convicts – that put the fear of prison into them. By the close of season two Piper has dumped Larry (Jason Biggs), the hapless fiancé she left on the outside, for a volatile reunion with Alex, earned the safe indifference of her peers and – as a benchmark measure of her transformation – even finds herself losing patience with the younger version of her old self in new inmate Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn).', 'Come season three, Piper’s a fully fledged jailbird, graduating from witless blonde to savvy crime boss, overseeing a cottage industry selling used prison panties to fetishists (another to-good-to-be-true plot-line based on real life events). Is this proof she’s learnt to fend for herself, sans trust fund? Or has prison merely fomented some innate, white-capitalist instinct? When the inmates she employs to grease those panties find out she’s paying them a pittance and form a union to demand a better wage, it seems the answer is: both.', 'The sprawling cast of characters Piper orbits are just as, if not more, compelling than the series’ figurehead we all love to hate. Heartbreaking, inspiring and hilarious by turns, their origin stories – like Piper’s – are told gradually, piecemeal, through compelling flashbacks. Making sense of the inmates individually – who they are, how they came to be at Litchfield, how they navigate their sentence and each other – is the crux of OITNB’s charm.', 'Among the shifting cast of supporting and major players is the aforementioned Red; Suzanne ‘Crazy Eyes’ Warren, Uzo Aduba’s violent yet loveably vulnerable psych ward veteran; trans bombshell Sophia Burset, played with grace and depth by activist and Time magazine cover star Laverne Cox; Dayanara ‘Daya’ Diaz, a daughter of the Hispanic clique who ends up pregnant following an illicit relationship with one of the prison guards; Natasha Lyonne’s wise-cracking ex-junkie Nicole ‘Nicky’ Nichols; comedian Lea Delaria’s fat, swaggering butch Big Boo and Tasha ‘Taystee’ Jefferson, the effervescently entertaining librarian played by Danielle Brooks.', 'The sweet, chatty simpatico Taystee and bestie Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) enjoy is a delight: incisive, gesticulating real-talk delivered with carefree wit, and frequently used to troll Piper’s gormless bystander (Taystee to Pouseey, in fake middle-class accent: “Amanda, did you hear that new piece on NPR about hedge funds?”).', 'This affectionate and tender bond is jeopardised in season two, when Taystee’s Machiavellian foster mother Yvone ‘Vee’ Parker (Lorraine Toussain) arrives at Litchfield and wastes no time commandeering the circle, turning the crew into drug dealers and instigating a violent bathroom turf war with the Hispanics in the process. Vee’s grooming and exploitation of Crazy Eyes – and the upsetting scenes this produces – is supremely acted and deeply uncomfortable viewing.', 'These constantly shifting inmate dynamics – romances, feuds, friendships, allegiances – are compelling stuff, but the power struggles between the prisoners and the mostly male prison staff provide some meaty plot-lines. Kohan ensures the guards, as much as Piper, are complex, layered characters rather than slotting them into any rote villain/protector binary – men struggling with their respective definitions of masculinity in a women-centric space. We see a surprisingly vulnerable side to Pablo Schreiber’s gloriously sleazy macho man George ‘Pornstache’ Mendez (graduate of the Jim Fenner school of screws) in season two, while Councillor Healy (Michael Harney) vacillates precariously between harmless, grey-haired grandpa and vicious, immature homophobe throughout – with sometimes dire consequences for Litchfield’s most vulnerable inmates.', 'OITNB is a show about women, and how we survive a society so thoroughly rigged in patriarchy’s favour. It’s about the joy and pain of female relationships, and the ingenious, wonderful and desperate things women do to survive life behind bars.', 'Kohan – working closely with Kerman, who left prison and became an active advocate for reform – is careful to root every drama and plot to real, historic and current socio-political issues. Haitian old timer Claudette Pelage (Michelle Hurst)’s story of exploitative child labour speaks to the ongoing crisis that is immigration; trafficking in the west is an issue which Diane Guerrero, who plays Maritza Ramos’s tough Latina hood princess, has articulated first-hand knowledge of off-camera; Sophia’s struggles to access hormones and with transphobic violence address the real and tragic issue of trans folk’s fettered access to essential healthcare and treatment in prison. And in season three – when Litchfield is privatised – we see the multitude of ways the corrupt prison-industrial complex puts profit before human life. Very little here feels superfluous, with the forgivable exception of Ruby Rose’s gratuitous nude scene in season three.', 'Gripping (and frequently hilarious) plots, razor-sharp dialogue, a talented, diverse cast and ubiquitous queerness elevate OITNB above prison dramas of yesteryear. This is TV finessed for an intersectional, privilege-checking era – not just savvy to the (white cis middle-class) male gaze but flipping it the bird. While out lesbian characters are slowly filtering into mainstream programming, they’re still frequently cliché, tokenised or killed off – victims of the dead lesbian trope.', 'Litchfield isn’t without its casualties, but on the whole its various queers are believable and investment-worthy, from Poussey’s adorably cheerful boi and Crazy Eyes’ Shakespeare-quoting weirdo to intellectual pin-up Alex Vause\xa0aka ‘the Betty Page of Litchfield’, as Boo christens her. The tangled, romantic dance that Piper and Alex do is compelling, nuanced and sexy where, in other hands, it might have felt exploitative.', 'With so many diverse LGBTQ women – stretching across age, race, size and creed – OITNB feels for many (this writer included) like the progressive, politicised next-gen answer to Ilene Chaiken’s much-missed, groundbreaking Showtime series The L Word – an enjoyable coincidence given that Chaiken’s first post-L Word project was slated to be a women’s prison-based spin-off called The Farm.', 'It’s far from niche queer viewing, though; OITNB’s reach into pop culture has made each new season an occasion event, warranting a zillion memes, binge-viewing TV parties and prison-themed gatherings, not to mention the ‘no OITNB spoilers please’ requests that proliferate online when social media users have to wait till work is over to devour a new series.

comedy "['It’s almost impossible to be a good parent anymore — offspring, once grown, seem to have an endless appetite for reproach. An alarming number of new TV comedies this season focus on the strain that annoying parents put on their resentful progeny. Children are never satisfied: a neglectful father ruins his child’s self-worth and ability to trust; a doting, successful father is impossible to live up to.', 'Those axioms are the basis of two comedies that begin this week: “Back in the Game” and “The Crazy Ones,” both father-daughter sitcoms that act out the discontents of Generation Xers who “journal” and use “parenting” as a verb.', '“The Goldbergs,” which began Tuesday on ABC, is the counterpoint: It’s a nostalgic look back at a simpler time long ago — the 1980s — when, as the narrator puts it, “there were no parenting blogs or peanut allergies, just a whole lot of crazy.”', 'It would be great if “The Goldbergs” were the wittier show of the three — Jeff Garlin (“Curb Your Enthusiasm”) plays the kind of dad who hollers, tells his children they are morons and proudly gives his middle son an REO Speedwagon tape for his birthday, which his son, who favors Flavor Flav, takes as an insult.', 'But the characters and mishaps on “The Goldbergs” are predicable, and the writing isn’t clever enough to overcome clichés: the pushy, overbearing mother; the sulky teenage son who wants his driver’s license; the popular older sister who finds her brothers unbearable. George Segal plays the roguish grandpa who helps the children get around parents who don’t understand them.', '“The Goldbergs” mostly serves as a contradiction to the rule that writers should draw on what they know. Like “The Wonder Years,” this is a coming-of-age comedy told in the first person. The show’s creator, Adam F. Goldberg, modeled it so closely on his own childhood that his family photos are next to shots of the actors at the end of the pilot. The entire episode feels like a home movie that a dinner host insists on showing his guests — it’s only funny to those in it.', '“Back in the Game,” an ABC show that begins on Wednesday, has a better start, even if it’s not all that inventive, either. The show puts the kind of father-daughter conflict that Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams explored in the movie “Trouble With the Curve” into a “Bad News Bears” setting. Terry (Maggie Lawson), a single mother, is broke and has to move in with her crabby, estranged father, who is also called Terry but goes by “the Cannon” and is played by James Caan.', 'Terry is bitter about her tough childhood — her father was a minor league coach who left her with relatives after her mother died. To please him, she became a college all-star softball player and still resents that she never saw the Cannon at any of her games. Their relationship is tense, but after Terry volunteers to coach her son’s losing baseball team, she needs her father’s help.', 'The family conflicts are facile and easily resolved on “Back in the Game,” but Terry is an appealing heroine, and she has an amusing new best friend, Lulu (Lenora Crichlow), a rich widow, and an appalling new enemy, Dick (Ben Koldyke), a rival coach with an ego as big as a baseball diamond.', '“The Crazy Ones” is a CBS show that begins on Thursday and features a heroine, Sydney (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who cannot complain that her successful, doting father doesn’t take care of her. Robin Williams plays her father, Simon Roberts, a senior partner at a big-time advertising firm who brought Sydney into the business and made her a partner. When Simon improvises a pitch to Coca-Cola, Sydney reminds him that she is his business partner by noting that the company is called Lewis, Roberts & Roberts. Her father replies: “Really?

Sydney is as much a scolding nanny as she is a collaborator. Simon is supposed to be a genuinely mad Mad Man, a childlike creative genius who delights in jokes, funny voices and inspired nonsense.

Last fall, “Bob’s Burgers” filled the slot in the Fox animation block that was previously held by “King of the Hill.” Like the other shows in that block, this animated series is not for the kids, but it features them in the most uncomfortable of situations. The show follows a family that runs and lives above a burger restaurant in an unnamed coastal town. The family struggles to keep their business afloat while the parents deal with the crazy nature of the kids.', 'What started with “The Simpsons” more than twenty years ago has blossomed into a huge enterprise for Fox. It continues to dominate the marketplace in adult-natured cartoons with only and occasional cable series like “South Park” or something from the Adult Swim line to give it any competition.', 'With the shows from Seth MacFarlane crowding the marketplace, this is a welcome break from what has become the standard (and it plays so much fresher than that “Cleveland Show” spin-off). It’s a more subtle comedy than either “The Simpsons” or the MacFarlane line, throwing in a lot of dry humor from the parents. The zaniness and freshness comes from the children, mainly because they don’t feel like retreads of other animated, inappropriate children from other shows.', 'Making jokes about child molesters, puberty, necrophilia, cannibalism and good, old-fashioned murder, “Bob’s Burgers” doesn’t shy away from topics. Still, it’s not overtly a gross-out show, either.', 'The anchor of the show is Bob, voiced by H. John Benjamin, whom many people will recognize as the voice of Archer in his own series. In fact, I like to think of this series as a long-form undercover assignment for Isis in a parallel universe where Sterling Archer is actually a committed spy.', 'However, the charm comes from the kids. The obvious one is Louise, voiced by Kristen Schaal (oddly enough, the only woman who voices one of the three main female roles). She’s the Bart Simpson or Eric Cartman of the bunch, playing dangerously precocious and manipulating situations. However, the son Gene, who seems to be a bit of a moron with some alarming health problems, has some great moments too.', 'But I think my favorite character is the other daughter, Tina, who was originally conceived as a boy. After reworking the character, the show kept the male voice but made her a girl budding into her own pubescent sexuality. She’s as awkward as they come, and she the driest of the bunch in terms of humor, but this makes her one of the most unique animated sit com kids I’ve seen in a while.', 'It’s not the most watched show in the Fox animation block, but it should be. “Bob’s Burgers” has great potential and already has shown some excellent humor in its first season.', 'The DVD set comes with 13 episodes on two discs. Special features include audio commentary on all episodes, audio outtakes for two episodes, the original demo with an introduction by the series creator, a music video and a spotlight on Louise as she explains how the command structure works in her family.

We also learn about the gang’s doppelgangers and how they affected their lives in 2009. We also get a brief glimpse at Ted Mosby’s future wife… even if it is just her feet.', 'WHAT I LIKED\nPeople who complain about the fact that we never actually get to meet the mother on “How I Met Your Mother” are really missing the point of the show. Sure, it’s called “How I Met Your Mother,” but it’s really just an excuse to give us a modern-day “Seinfeld” in which these beloved characters bounce around from relationship to relationship and get into all sorts of trouble.', 'The key to a show like this is to not grow at all. We don’t want to meet Ted’s mother… not really. After all, it’s more fun to watch him flop in and out of relationships. Likewise, you really don’t want Robin to settle down with Barney because that would kill the dynamic of the show. At least so far, the people behind “How I Met Your Mother” seem to understand this. Let’s not have the characters progress because if they do – and by default become more mature – we lose what makes them funny.', '“How I Met Your Mother” defines situational comedy. It introduces a different silly plot line – from Barney giving up his powerful playbook of ways to get women to sleep with him to Ted and Marshall driving to Chicago to eat some of the worst (but also the best) pizza in the country.', 'This season ushers in the benchmark 100th episode of the series, which includes a production number reminiscent of “The Drew Carey Show.” It also has some choice guest stars, including Jennifer Lopez, Carrie Underwood, Rachel Bilson, Stacey Kiebler and a hilarious appearance by Amanda Peet.', '“How I Met Your Mother” is one of the better sit coms out there, bringing back the joy of the sit com we saw in the 70s. Like “The Big Bang Theory,” it serves as an excuse to give us funny, sexy and borderline-inappropriate material in a very safe setting. When “How I Met Your Mother” has a “very special episode,” we know it’ll all be over.', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nWhile I haven’t watched this show from the beginning, I consider myself a fan of it now. It takes a little time to warm up to the characters, and it’s almost unappealing if you’re not familiar with them. However, after a couple episodes, the show is brilliantly funny. It’s not meant to change the world, but neither were shows like “Three’s Company” or “Seinfeld.”', 'There’s plenty for one to complain about this show – from recycled sit com plots to bad behavior condoned by the characters – but that’s really part of the fun of the series. So, you can loft those claims, but you’re just not getting into the fun of things.', 'DVD FEATURES\nThis fifth season DVD set includes some pretty nice special features, especially for a fifth season of a show. There’s a blooper reel, stand-alone music videos for the songs from the series, a behind-the-scenes “Making of Super Date,” the full trailer for the film-within-a-show “The Wedding Bride,” a behind-the-scenes featurette on the musical number from the 100th episode and a series recap.', 'WHO’S GOING TO LIKE THIS MOVIE\nPeople who like the traditional, not-out-to-solve-the-world’s-problems sit com.

But wisecracking is apparently a finer art than it may seem on the surface. Remember ""Moonlighting""? At first, Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis delivered their verbal love taps with sweet fluid grace, but after a few seasons, the repartee began to feel forced and phony. ', ""Today, a number of shows try too hard to crack wise and don't always make it work, first, because their lead players may not have the right chemistry, and, second, because the series writers are clearly too concerned that the wisecracking not go over the heads of the audience."", ""James Roday and Dulé Hill, who play fake police psychic Shawn and his long-suffering best friend, Gus, have great chemistry, but more important, their show has writers who are absolutely nuts and don't care if you get the inside jokes or not. "", 'Each episode is delicately laced with wisecracked asides and pop culture references, some of them obscure and others just plain silly and obvious. ', ""The show's premise is that although Shawn isn't really a psychic, he is very observant and manages to solve crimes on a regular basis by focusing on clues otherwise overlooked by the department's Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), a by-the-book stickler whom Shawn always calls Lassie."", 'In tonight\'s season opener, ""Romeo and Juliet and Juliet,"" Shawn and Gus work their way into the case of the apparent kidnapping of the daughter of the leader of a powerful Asian triad (which Shawn thinks has something to do with athletic competition). Shawn\'s dad, Henry (Corbin Bernson), a retired cop, has been pulled back onto the Santa Barbara force and doesn\'t want Shawn and Gus hired on the case, which doesn\'t stop them.', "" Meanwhile, Shawn's kinda-sorta would-be love interest, Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson), has been reassigned to desk duty and resists Shawn's effort to drag her into the case, but, predictably, not for long."", ""The comic center of the episode comes when Shawn talks his way into a martial arts class - for 8-year-olds, arguing that he needs to make up for the fact that his father wouldn't let him take karate when he was a kid. The fact that he's managed to splinter a board makes him think he can take on the bad guys of the rival triads."", 'Two years ago, ""Psych"" got a little competition in the fake-psychic business with the arrival of ""The Mentalist"" on CBS. But the writers (and Roday and Hill, who are among the show\'s producers) took it all in comic stride, dropping little digs at the Simon Baker show into dialogue from time to time - digs that managed to make fun of their own phony-psychic premise as much as ""The Mentalist\'s."" Very classy.', 'So how do Shawn and Gus solve the kidnapping? Fans of the show don\'t really care, any more than they care if Shawn and Juliet will ever get together.

comedy "['The end of the world definitely comes with a whimper in “The Last Man on Earth,” Will Forte’s sitcom subversion of the ubiquitous apocalypse drama, whose first two episodes have their premiere on Sunday night on Fox.', 'Mr. Forte, the longtime “Saturday Night Live” cast member and “MacGruber” star, created the series and wrote the first two episodes, which were directed by the hot feature-film team of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (“The Lego Movie,” the “Jump Street” films).', 'Writing about “Last Man” is a tricky exercise in spoiler avoidance — certain things will be revealed here in the name of criticism. Such as: The distinctive, charming first episode is very nearly a solo half-hour for Mr. Forte, who stars as Phil, seemingly the only survivor of a pandemic that struck the planet in 2018.', 'Set in 2020, the first half-hour is a self-contained comic gloss on solitude scenarios like “I Am Legend” and, particularly, “Castaway,” which is directly invoked. Phil travels the 50 states in an RV looking for other humans, driving down the center of an empty mall (that’s New Jersey) and leaving Utah until the very end. Unsuccessful, he goes home to Tucson and does what your average middle-aged male former temp worker would do: moves into a suburban McMansion, stockpiles porn and uses the pool as a toilet.', 'This initial episode is unusual not so much for its story line and relative quiet (though Phil does talk to himself) as for its wistful tone and its reliance on sly visual jokes over written gags. It feels like a cable comedy that’s found its way onto a broadcast network — you’d expect it on FX, home of “Louie” and “Wilfred,” but it’s surprising on Fox.', 'Some of the show’s appeal dissipates after that, however. It’s not giving away too much to say that Phil eventually does find another survivor, Carol, who’s played by Kristen Schaal (“Bob’s Burgers”), with her crazy eyes and dentist’s-drill voice. The second episode takes the show in a different and more ordinary direction. Fulfilling the wordplay in the title, “Last Man” becomes a kind of essentialist romantic comedy: A couple who seem destined to be together — because they are, after all, the last man and the last woman on earth — are kept apart by their pride and prejudices.', 'This part of the story, an allegory for the modern world of dating and marriage, with Carol representing civilization (she wants running water) and Phil representing id (he’s happy to keep urinating in the pool), is distinctly less inventive than the opening. And the writing is condescending to Ms. Schaal’s character. Phil is slovenly and lazy in an average-Joe kind of way; Carol, who forces him to stop at stop signs and insists on making eye contact when they clink glasses, is uptight in a stereotypically neurotic way. (She also comes across as not very bright.)', 'A third episode extends the rom-com theme, and leaves you wondering where the story will go, until a last-minute surprise that pretty much tells you. (If you’re curious, Google which other actors have been signed for the cast.) “The Last Man on Earth” is well made, meticulous in its comic details and pleasantly acted by Mr. Forte and Ms. Schaal, but you may wish that it really had been about the last man on earth.', 'Produced by 20th Century Fox Television.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'The odds seem stacked in ""Logan Lucky""\'s favor\xa0the instant you spot ""Directed by Steven Soderbergh"" in the opening credits. Sure enough, it\'s a winner. Soderbergh is one of the reigning masters of the heist picture: he did the ""Ocean\'s Eleven"" remake and its two sequels, plus ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Underneath."" This one\'s about a bunch of good ol’ boys trying to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, but the vibe is so similar to Soderbergh\'s hit heist trilogy that a TV newscaster fesses up by describing the gang in this one as ""Ocean\'s 7-Eleven."" The movie is put together with the no-fuss confidence of Soderbergh\'s best entertainments, staging comedic banter and suspense sequences with equal assurance, even playing sly perception games with the audience by making you wonder how smart or dumb the characters (and the movie) actually are. ', 'The story centers on two brothers, both wounded war veterans. Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), a onetime coal miner, lost a leg in the service. Jimmy’s younger brother Clyde (Adam Driver) lost part of an arm, and now tends bar at a roadside saloon where Jimmy is a regular. An obnoxious customer jokes that if you put the Logan boys together, you’d get a whole person. That\'s not too far off the mark: like redneck cousins of George Clooney and Brad Pitt\'s characters in the ""Ocean\'s"" movies, they amplify each other\'s better qualities, and maintain a united front even when they disagree. Legend has it that the Logan family, which also includes a badass, hot-car-driving kid sister named Mellie (Riley Keough), is cursed. Throughout ""Logan Lucky,"" you keep wondering if the curse will rear its head and ruin the plan Jimmy has cooked up with Clyde and a third partner, an imprisoned explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who\'s five months away from release.', 'It’s a heck of a scheme. Seems the Charlotte Motor Speedway has a sinkhole problem, and Jimmy was part of the team of ex-coal miners brought in to fix it. While toiling beneath the stadium, he learned that concession stand earnings are delivered to a cash vault deep in the basement by way of pneumatic tubes. The Logans promise that with a little help from Joe they can break into the vault, steal the cash, and walk away rich. Joe says he’d be happy to join the team if he weren’t, as he sneers, ""In...CAR...cer...a...TED."" No biggie. The Logan boys offer to bust Joe out of prison long enough to join the heist, then sneak him back in. ', 'At this point you may start to wonder how smart the Logans actually are and how seriously we\'re supposed to take their boasting. There are two kinds of people who make promises like the ones the Logans make to Joe Bang: hotshots and idiots. The characters in this film are drawn with broad enough strokes that they could go either way. The Logans and the Bangs—including Joe\'s younger brothers, Sam and Fish (Brian Gleeson and Jack Quaid), one of whom claims to be a computer expert who knows ""all the Twitters""—are a loquacious bunch of misfits and scalawags, nervy as hell. But sometimes they sound like characters from one of those Coen brothers movies filled with dimwitted braggarts—think ""Raising Arizona""\xa0or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""—and each one has a different accent.  Driver sounds like Forrest Gump eating peanut butter, Craig has the barbecued hambone drawl of a sheriff from a 1970s hicksploitation picture, and there are times when Tatum seems to forget to have one. Only Keough, the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, seems as rooted in life as  the screenplay\'s references to NASCAR fandom, the child beauty pageant circuit, contaminated groundwater, and the fall of  the mining industry. ', 'You may also wonder if this is the  kind of film that believes in curses. Some films do, some don\'t, and others leave you guessing. There are no curses in ""The Sting"" or ""Ocean’s Eleven,"" but characters in Coen brothers\xa0films often do seem cursed, not just by their own overconfidence or stupidity, but by coincidence, misunderstanding or fate. Things go well enough early on in ""Logan Lucky"" that you start wondering about the movie\'s point of view on destiny, bad mojo, and the like. Is the movie\'s title sincere, ironic, or neither?', 'All questions are answered in due time. The screenplay is credited to Rebecca Blunt, supposedly a young first-timer getting her big break, but it’s an open secret that it was really written by Soderbergh’s wife Jules Asner, who hails from West Virginia. She partly based Jimmy, a faded high school football star, on Channing Tatum, who grew up poor in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, and was headed for a college football scholarship until he wrecked his knee and turned to stripping and modeling instead (see the Tatum/Soderbergh ""Magic Mike"" collaborations). ', ""Soderbergh directs the script (and edited and shot it under pseudonyms—a Soderbergh family tradition, it seems) with his characteristic smoothness, moving through the story so deftly that you don't realize you've already gone from point A to point B until you're  already en route to point C. There’s no wasted motion. Everything  happens as it does for a reason. There are points where you might assume that the film is rushing through incidents that it can’t adequately explain or justify, or just flat-out forgetting to give details that would make a character’s actions make sense. But that proves not to be the case. The film gives out information on a need-to-know basis: if you don’t need it, you won’t know it.  "", 'This need-to-know  aesthetic carries all the way down to the level of individual shots. Soderbergh\'s camera is  constantly framing scenes and moving through space in order to conceal or reveal information  about the characters\' motives and the progress of the heist. Some shots are structured like well-wrought jokes—one where you think you  know where the story is headed, then laugh out loud when it takes you someplace  else. A lot of times you have no idea what you\'re looking at or why it\'s important until Soderbergh moves a bit to the left or shifts focus to make you go, ""Aha!"" There are few working directors who still know how to make a film this way. Soderbergh is one of them. ', '""Logan Lucky"" is not a deep or particularly original film and isn\'t trying to be, and there are moments when you might wish that it had taken an extra scene or beat to flesh out its oddball characters and give them more than two dimensions (though there are moments—the one set at a school recital, in particular—that do exactly that). And a couple of characters who are introduced with great fanfare (notably a clinic worker played by Katherine Waterston, and an FBI agent played by Hilary Swank who snarls like Clint Eastwood) don\'t make as much of an impression as they should. But it\'s precision-tooled entertainment made by experts, and sometimes more than that. Watching it is like finding money in the pocket of a coat that you haven’t worn in years.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Going into “Battle of the Sexes,” one might expect an equally-balanced look at the lives of self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs and tennis superstar Billie Jean King. This is not that movie. And it shouldn’t be really. The best angle of the film is the way it illuminates the difference between fighting for equality and battling to hold on to perceived superiority. Of course, this is a fight that continues to this day, and not just in terms of gender. If anything, there’s a better version of “Battle of the Sexes” that focuses even more fully on King, villainizing Riggs and his grotesque culture of sexism in a way this movie disappointingly seems scared to do. The material involving King’s fight for equality is powerful, and the performances are uniformly strong, but there’s a TV movie approach to the emotion and truth of this situation that softens it in detrimental ways. It’s not a “bad” film, but Billie Jean King’s story could have been so much deeper. It’s a movie that doesn’t hit nearly as hard as she did.', 'King is played by the Oscar-winning Emma Stone, who captures her unique blend of determined grit and awkward social behavior. Her take on King is relatively shy and spotlight-averse, the opposite of the gregarious Bobby Riggs, portrayed by Steve Carell. A gambling addict, the 55-year-old Riggs has lost his drive, looking for the next hustle to keep him happy, even as his bad habits frustrate his wife, played in a totally thankless role by Elizabeth Shue. When the head of the Tennis Association, played with an almost caricature degree of smarm by Bill Pullman, offers a tournament in which the female winner will get $1,500 while the male winner gets $12,000, King jumps ship, and she takes almost every female tennis player that matters with her. Led by Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), the ladies form their own tennis tour, and the world notices, including Bobby Riggs.', 'While Riggs is looking for his next big thing, King is confronted with something she didn’t expect, a romance with her hairdresser, Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough). Happily married to Larry (Austin Stowell), Billie Jean never expected to fall in love with another woman, and it’s the kind of affair that could destroy her career, especially as the new tour is trying to find sponsors. With this new romance as the backdrop, King ends up agreeing to a one-time match with Riggs, who believes that an over-the-hill male tennis player can still beat the #1 young, female tennis champion. While a lot of the people around her see this as just a gimmick, she realizes the message it could send to the world if she loses. ', 'With copious amounts of ‘70s style and music, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (“Little Miss Sunshine”) work hard to recreate a period in which male chauvinism could still be very easily taken as a public position. It’s hard to imagine a dinosaur like Bobby Riggs getting any attention beyond a small core of morons nowadays. Even if his brand of sexism is depressingly alive and well, it’s not the kind of thing sports announcers openly defend. Listening to Howard Cosell and company legitimize Riggs’ worldview shows how much of a culture King had to work to tear down.', 'However, it also makes one wonder why writer Simon Beaufoy didn’t take a tougher stance against Riggs. Scenes with his wife and child are clearly designed to humanize him in a way that feels oddly disingenuous. At one point, he’s a goofy charmer, but then we see how much larger a hill that King had to climb because of the Riggs brand of sexism and it’s hard not wish the movie didn’t too often treat him as a harmless clown. There’s a better version of “Battle of the Sexes” that focuses more completely on just King because this half-developed, comedy approach to Riggs’ life doesn’t add enough to this version.', 'As for performances, Dayton & Faris have always been strong with an ensemble, and that’s true here as well. Stone is subtle and powerful, but Riseborough actually gives my favorite performance of the film, playing someone who feels more three-dimensional than the icons at the center of the piece. Similarly, Alan Cumming does a lot with just a few scenes, which isn’t that unusual for him. Less fortunate are Shue and Pullman, turned into the archetypes of the Frustrated Wife and the Sexist Boss. The final scenes of Pullman sneering as he watches the match might as well have had him twirling a curled mustache. It’s that superficial approach to the world around Billie Jean King that diminishes her story. Instead of a timeless story, this feels like a Hollywood production that softens what was truly and genuinely a battle, one that women are still fighting today.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

This premise — two frenemies are forced together when their husbands announce they are gay and plan to marry each other — seems more like that of a conventional sitcom, which makes sense given that Marta Kauffman, a co-creator of “Friends,” is an executive producer.', 'Even the star power of its lead actresses isn’t necessarily a slam dunk: Ms. Fonda and Ms. Tomlin, who were co-stars in the 1980 comedy “9 to 5,” have recently had roles in some good projects, but also some really bad ones, like the 2014 film “This Is Where I Leave You,” in which Ms. Fonda starred.', 'Ms. Fonda brings an underlay of vulnerability to Grace, a brittle, vain retired cosmetics executive, and Ms. Tomlin adds some sass to Frankie, a New Agey artist. Together, they pull this comedy about 70-somethings back from the brink of ridicule. It helps that the series is shot like a movie, albeit one from Nancy Meyers, with heroines who suffer under good lighting in fine restaurants and exquisite beach houses. Ms. Meyers, however, makes romantic comedies about older women who magically find Mr. Next. This series covers a later phase in life, somewhere between late-blooming love and assisted living.', 'And it’s been a while since a series was so intently centered on the early-bird-special set. Betty White has a leading role in TV Land’s “Hot in Cleveland,” but she is not the focus, she serves instead as a white-haired foil to middle-aged single women on that show. Mostly, older stars are still cast as crusty grandparents or needy neighbors.', 'But generational anxiety seems to have fresh currency at the moment. Showtime recently introduced “Happyish,” a so-so comedy about younger upstarts elbowing aside their elders in an advertising firm. “Younger,” on TV Land, is better, and it covers the same clash of cohorts. It’s a comedy about a divorced 40-year-old suburban woman who pretends to be in her 20s so she can go back to work in publishing; she has to use Snapchat and get Brazilian waxes to fit in.', 'Netflix is hedging its bets. “Grace and Frankie” is pitched toward one demographic. Later this month, Netflix will stream six episodes of “Between,” a Canadian dystopian thriller about what happens to the fictional town of Pretty Lake after a mysterious disease starts killing everyone over the age of 21, leaving only the young to run the town. (Social media is flooded with tweets like #RIPPrettyLake.) It’s not the “Lord of the Flies” scenario that makes “Between” scary; it’s the subliminal payoff: millennial wish fulfillment. Television shows tend to reflect the preoccupations of their creators, and ageism is a fact of Hollywood life. It’s not just older actresses who feel discarded. Even people behind the camera crane their necks scanning the horizon for invading hordes of Visigoths — the ones on fixed-gear bikes with neck tattoos and blunt-cut bangs.', 'Grace and Frankie thought they would grow old with their husbands, not each other. The two women don’t actually get along, but are forced to air kiss and feign affection because Grace’s husband, Robert (Martin Sheen), and Frankie’s, Sol (Sam Waterston), are law partners and best friends.', 'When the men announce that they are also longtime lovers and want to divorce their wives, Grace and Frankie are at first disbelieving and stunned, especially about why their husbands waited so long to come out. Robert explains that they now want to marry because in California, at long last, they can.', 'The women share indignation as well as panic, sorrow and anger. Grace complains that Robert and Sol get to live happily ever after and also hog the high road, since they are gay and not run-of-the-mill skirt-chasers. Had they left their wives for younger women they would be viewed as heels; in Malibu, at least, they are heroes.', 'Grace and Frankie find that without important husbands, they vanish. Old friends don’t call and strangers don’t even acknowledge them. In one scene, the normally poised Grace is incensed when a male supermarket cashier doesn’t turn to serve them or even acknowledge their waves, pleas and yoo-hoos. He has eyes and time only for a pretty young woman who saunters up asking for lottery tickets.', 'Grace has a screaming meltdown, and Frankie ushers her back to the car and reveals an upside: She stole a pack of cigarettes. “We have a superpower,” Frankie says slyly. “You can’t see me, you can’t stop me.”', ""A version of this review appears in print on May 8, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Comedy Enters a New Age .

comedy "['A documentary about the final year of foreign policy during the Obama administration, and incidentally about the grim surprises that life sometimes has in store…', '""The Ballad of Narayama"" is a Japanese film of great beauty and elegant artifice, telling a story of startling cruelty. What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', '“The worst thing that could ever happen to anybody has landed on you … and now you just have to deal with it.” And most of us, if we’re lucky, don’t have to deal with “the worst thing” alone. Richard Linklater’s moving “Last Flag Flying,” a quasi-sequel to Hal Ashby’s “The Last Detail,” is a film built on the deeply humanist career of its filmmaker, one that is about, at its core, what we’re willing to do for one another on our darkest days. It is about being there for people when they need a shoulder to cry on or a hand to help them get up. And it reflects Linklater’s undeniable belief in humankind. Is there any filmmaker who so clearly loves his characters more than Linklater? Jesse and Celine in the “Before” films; the kids of “Dazed and Confused” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”; everyone in “Boyhood”—Linklater’s affection for the people he presents is palpable, and it’s that graceful humanity that keeps “Last Flag Flying” from descending into melodrama. It dips a few too many times to stand with the filmmaker’s best work, and a few asides into “wacky old person behavior” are regrettable, but this is another solid dramedy from one of our best working filmmakers.', 'Larry ‘Doc’ Shepherd (Steve Carell) has had an absolutely horrific year. His wife recently passed of cancer, and he just received news that his son, Larry Jr., died in combat in Iraq—the film takes place in late 2003 (we see Saddam Hussein’s capture on TV screens). The news that Larry has to accompany his son’s body to Arlington has rattled him and he needs some people by his side to whom he hasn’t spoken in decades, his two Vietnam buddies, Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston) and the Reverend Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne). Cranston is doing a loose riff on what Nicholson did in the original Ashby film, playing the rebellious, hard-drinking, tough-talking member of the trio; Fishburne is the now-religious man who hasn’t lost the passion of his youth, he’s merely channeled it into something else; Carell sometimes looks like a shell of a man, giving the most subdued performance, and one of the best, of his career. What follows is basically an actor’s showcase in the form of a road movie.   ', 'And it’s one heck of a showcase. Linklater has received ample credit throughout his career as one of our best writers, but his work with performers still feels underrated. Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Julie Delpy—Linklater has directed them to performances that would be on any highlight reel of their entire careers. And he does phenomenal work here as an actor’s director, allowing Carell, Fishburne, Cranston, and relative newcomer J. Quinton Johnson (as a soldier who has to accompany the men) to do fantastic, character-driven work. There’s great joy in watching actors this talented being given the space to develop their characters in such a way that the performer fades away and we only see the character. There’s a scene near the end in which the quartet is conversing on a train in which I realized how well-rounded and developed all four performers were in that moment.   ', 'Sadly, Linklater and co-writer Darryl Ponicsan (who also wrote the book and ""The Last Detail"") don’t always trust the truth of their situation, ladling on sitcom-ish asides that really grate, although none go on long enough to completely sink the film. The old guys getting confused for terrorists; going on an excursion to buy something mysterious called a cell phone; breaking down Eminem’s “Without Me,” which Sal is stunned to learn is sung by a white guy—these are all regrettable diversions from the truth of the film because they all feel so completely like a writer’s contrivances.   ', '“Last Flag Flying” is far more interesting when it gets philosophical. There’s an interesting undercurrent of faith at play in this story—faith in a higher power that leads one into life as a Reverend or faith in a system that orders young men to die in impossible wars, and ultimately a faith in each other to do the right thing. I wish it was even more daring in terms of how this theme is explored, but it’s definitely there. I also wanted more examination of the individual vs. the institution, most reflected in the decision over whether or not to bury Larry in his uniform. Does the uniform represent the man who gave his life or the system that took it? And what about the flag? Again, I feel like there’s a slightly more daring, thematically strident version of “Last Flag Flying” that could have elevated this movie from good to great if it were willing to be just a few degrees more challenging.   ', 'Linklater doesn’t help the opinion some will have that this is a bit too manipulative with a score that hits the tinkly piano chords whenever emotion comes into the narrative, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to being moved on more than one occasion. Death comes into all of our lives. If we’re lucky, it doesn’t come into our lives when it comes to our own children. We’re not all so lucky. People very important to me are dealing with the injustice of death as I write this, and “Last Flag Flying” reminded me how essential it is to just be there for them in whatever capacity I\xa0can. One of the last lines of the film is “Doc needs us.” Linklater is reminding people to be present when they’re needed. Be aware. Be caring. Be truthful. Be alive. More than anything, just be human.

comedy "['The on-screen pairing of Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson in The Ranch is sure to make viewers immediately think of That 70’s Show where the two gained fame (Kutcher more so than Masterson). But it’s more than just the casting that draws the comparison, it’s also the roles.', 'Kutcher plays Colt Bennett, a dim-witted and good-looking, pretty boy jock (sound familiar?) moving back home to his family’s ranch as his barely successful semi-pro football career finally sputters out. Masterson plays Rooster, the older brother, a smart ass cynic with a retort for everything (sound familiar again?). Their father Beau Bennett (Sam Elliot) is a conservative man’s-man tough guy who doles out plenty of judgement about the younger generation and state of the world (Red Foreman, anyone?). Oh, and there was mention of a guy named “Pedro”, though he has not yet appeared on screen. If there’s a season two, you can bet your life Pedro will be played by Wilmer Valderama. ', 'But there’s one more old friend joining Masterson and Kutcher on The Ranch: a laugh track. The presence of the laugh track was initially startling, just because it didn’t show up until the third joke. But then there it was, underlining every joke, big and small. The chortling of a fake TV audience is only one of several elements that sets The Ranch apart (not necessarily in a good way) from the rest of Netflix’s comedy stable. Whether it’s Bo-Jack Horseman, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, or Lady Dynamite, the rest of the Netflix comedies are smart, risk taking, and have\xa0fresh perspectives. The Ranch’s humor is very well trodden and would feel much more at home following a show like Two Broke Girls as a part of the CBS comedy lineup. Which, given the immense popularity of CBS’s traditional laugh-track style shows might indicate that the vanilla humor and style of The Ranch is intentional, a means for Netflix to capture a new audience perhaps. But regardless of the intent, The Ranch is not in the same league as the rest of the Netflix comedy family.', 'For starters, there are an uncomfortable number of jokes about having sex with high schoolers. Like, way too many. That might have worked pretty well for Kutcher an Masterson on That 70’s Show (when they were playing high schoolers), but their characters on The Ranch are in their mid-30’s and now it’s beyond creepy. The rest of the jokes include a lot of threats of putting their balls on each other’s stuff and their father finding 10 different ways per episode of calling them pussies for being born in a subsequent generation. There are not a lot of deep thinkers or quick witted zingers. It’s mostly standard sitcom fare.', 'The use of Sam Elliot as the tough, live-off-the-land, conservative father is particularly disappointing. Beau Bennett is essentially Parks and Rec‘s Ron Swanson with way worse lines. Elliot is a tremendously talented actor who is just woefully misused. Elliot is at his best when he’s cool as a cucumber and unflappable (think The Big Lebowski or those truck commercials he voices). In The Ranch he is a grumpy old man with back problems. It’s not easy to watch at times.', 'Overall, The Ranch will find some fans. Safe comedy is not always unpopular comedy. The Ranch may end up being a new direction for Netflix’s comedy division (“finally a show your parents will like!”), but it will be a big swing and a miss for fans of its other shows.', 'The Ranch is well acted comedy. The F bomb could definitely be left out of the show and the laugh track. It would still be funny.\nThis Ranch is nothing like that 70’s show!\nAnd credit to bringing back the actors from That 70’s show. I don’t know to many 30 year old men that don’t act like their still in high school unless their married. Then their just acting till they get with the boys.\nAs for two broke girls being funnier. REALLY. This is a show that has gone on because there’s nothing else to watch.\nThe Ranch is something new & predictable to who. You live in Colorado on a Ranch?\nI personally can’t wait for the new season.', 'There is a somewhat similar dynamic to 70’s show. The characters in the Ranch have more depth. I dont think you gave much credit for that.  If you watch past the first episode it gets better. If you ever lived in the south or worked on a ranch you would understand that the comedy and drama are appreciated by us simple country folk.  We can relate to the culture and drama.  I think that making a comedy/ drama would be difficult. I believe they pulled this off!  Reminds me of home.', 'Debra Winger and Sam Elliot in a new show?  I tuned in to see seasoned actors tackle what could have been a drama/some comedy story about a ranch family redefining itself. All that talent – among the other actors, too – and it’s only a laugh-track sitcom. Please save Ashton’s character from ridiculous stereotype and let Mr. Elliot join the family struggle rather than keep a static paternal stance.  This show can do much better.', 'Interesting review… You’re troubled by chronic referrals to sex with high schoolers and putting their balls on each other’s stuff (not accurate) and then to sum it up at the end comes a comment like  (“finally a show your parents will like!”) I’m a 61 year old and was troubled by some of the language and innuendos, but as a whole the show was well cast and Sam Elliott’s part of Beau Bennett is the glue to that.

Main character Christy (Anna Faris) doesn\'t drink and is shown attending AA meetings, but works in a restaurant where diners drink wine; her teenage daughter drinks and smokes pot (offscreen). Her ex-husband is also a pothead and would-be pot dealer, and her mom is an ex-cocaine user who still takes Xanax when she needs to ""calm down."" Sex is similarly played for laughs: Christy\'s teen daughter is sexually active and viewers see a teen boy leaving her room via the window.

She's a waitress instead of the psychologist she wanted to be. She has two kids, including a precocious teen. And she's only now starting to see eye to eye with her blithe floozy of a MOM (Allison Janney), who was too busy snorting cocaine and gallivanting with men to notice what her daughter was up to while she was growing up. Christy doesn't have it easy, particularly since she's newly sober. At least she has the support of her pals in Alcoholics Anonymous.

It is strangely impervious to problems that other shows face, like the characters pairing up and having long-lasting relationships.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Anger is an energy in Martin McDonagh’s brilliant “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” one of the best films of the year. In this “Southern American with an Irish attitude” story from the ""In Bruges"" writer/director that, like a lot of his work, recalls Flannery O’Connor in tone (the O\'Connor quote ""The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it"" could be this movie\'s tagline), anger is not treated like something to be cured. Hollywood likes to teach us that anger is a sin, and that only through acceptance and understanding can we find true happiness. Easier said than done, right? How can you not be angry at an unfair world? Life will take children before parents. Life will give cancer to relatively young people. Life will be racist, sexist, and cruel. And you should throw a few back and yell at something that unfair. You should fight. It is only through that fighting and that rage that other emotions like empathy and understanding can surface. Anger is not a disease to be cured but a path on the road to comprehending the world.', 'No one does angry better than Frances McDormand, who does her best film work here since “Fargo” as Mildred Hayes, a recently divorced mother who lost her daughter Angela less than a year ago. Angela was raped and murdered, but the case has gone cold. There was no matching DNA, so the spotlight has dimmed and Mildred is getting no updates. She’s angry. She should be. One day, she sees three barren billboards on a rarely-traveled road, and she rents the space to ask the local chief of police, played by Woody Harrelson, why there are no answers. Local media becomes interested in the billboards, and the attention sparks a series of events involving not only the chief but one of his more loathsome officers, played by Sam Rockwell. Peter Dinklage, Caleb Landry Jones, Abbie Cornish, Lucas Hedges, Clarke Peters, and John Hawkes fill out a ridiculously perfect supporting cast.', 'You might think you have your finger on what this will be like from that description, but McDonagh’s simply perfect script is never quite what you expect it to be. The mystery of what happened to Angela would have dominated other versions of this story, but this is not really that movie. On one level, it is more about cause and effect than crime and resolution. Mildred rents the billboards, which leads to pressure on the chief, which leads to anger from his loyal officer, and so on and so on down the line. McDonagh spares no one, allowing almost all of his characters to be deeply flawed, especially McDormand’s Mildred and Rockwell’s Dixon. Life has screwed over both of these people, and it has made them both angry. Mildred is channeling her anger to solve her daughter’s murder. Dixon has less of an idea of what to do with his, but one senses early on that it’s probably going to eventually cost him his job.', 'Rockwell often plays nice guys, but he’s more effective here as a racist, violent cop than you might expect. He looks older and pudgier, like he drinks himself to sleep every night and doesn’t really trust that life has much in store for him. Rockwell has a big arc in this film and he takes no false steps, as usual. Harrelson is great too, but the film belongs to McDormand, who can do more with a withering glare than most actresses can do with a monologue. She is simply stunning when it comes to internal language, so often revealing the pain underneath the rage. Her Mildred takes no prisoners, but also feels like someone literally torn apart inside by grief. McDormand can destroy a monologue, too—a scene with a priest offering counsel is an all-timer, earning applause at my screening—but she’s even more impressive in the minor beats. It’s the curl of a lip to fight back tears or the downward glance to stop herself from punching someone. This character is so completely, fully realized in ways that other actresses couldn’t have come anywhere close to capturing. It’s stunning to watch.', 'Of course, McDonagh deserves a ton of credit for not only directing her but giving her such a great part in such a smart script. Empathy and peace with the too-common injustice of our world is a common theme in cinema, but it’s usually handled with kid gloves or pat resolutions. There are no easy answers in McDonagh’s world—no clear-cut heroes and villains. You will start to question Mildred and you will start to defend Dixon. In a sense, that’s one of McDonagh’s most stunning tricks with this film. The world is more complex than most movies would have you think, and it takes a writer of his remarkable ability to convey that. He’s also operating at a more technically accomplished level than ever before, particularly in the way the film uses a great score from Coen regular Carter Burwell and well-balanced cinematography from Ben Davis.', 'Not every speedbump given us by life teaches us tolerance. A daughter shouldn’t die at all, much less brutally. But what do we do with that knowledge? How do we channel our anger at an unjust world? “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is one of those truly rare films that feels both profound and grounded; inspirational without ever manipulatively trying to be so.

The LNLWBKs started in January 2009, with the surprise smash ""Taken,"" and continued with more ""Taken"" movies, plus three Neeson adventures by Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of this new one (""Unknown,""\xa0""Non-Stop"" and ""Run All Night"" were the others). They\'re a staple of our moviegoing diet by this point, nearly as ingrained in the seasonal calendar as the holidays themselves.  Like nearly every entry, this new one is worth seeing for the unfussy determination of Neeson, a couple of impressively choreographed action sequences (in particular a one-take, hand-to-hand fight that attempts to one-up the famous hammer sequence in ""Oldboy""), and an intriguing premise that the filmmakers never manage to fully exploit. By ""worth seeing,"" I don\'t necessarily mean ""rush to the nearest theater, forsaking all else,"" but rather, ""if this comes on TV, you\'ll probably watch the whole thing, as long as you\'re not in a hurry to be somewhere."" Who knows, it might even be ideal train viewing. The plot has all the hallmarks of a daydream that got obsessively worked-over for years during somebody\'s daily rides to and from work.', ""Neeson's character, Michael MacCauley, is a 60-year-old ex-cop turned insurance salesman who works in midtown Manhattan. His boss tells him that he's being fired right when he's about to begin his return trip home to see his wife (Elizabeth McGovern, who deserves better than this) and college-aged son (Dean-Charles Chapman) in Westchester, Long Island. Michael loses his phone in the train station due to a pickpocket he doesn't realize bumped him on purpose, then meets a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga) who tells him he has to locate a certan passenger on the commuter train before it arrives at its final stop and plant a tracking device on him/her, at which point that person will be killed. Michael will get $25,000 up front and another $75,000 upon completion of the mission—enough to offset the economic havoc wrought by his firing, including the potential scuttling of a reverse-mortgage on the family home that would've paid for his son's college. "", ""This is one of those moral conundrums that really only generates suspense if you believe that a\xa0working class hero who radiates decency would condemn another person to death for $100,000. Nevertheless, Neeson goes the extra kilometer trying to sell us on the character's economic desperation as well as his macho pride (Michael couldn't bring himself to tell his wife and kids that he just got fired, so there's pressure to make this right immediately so he'll never have to spill the truth). "", 'Director Collet-Serra, who did the mostly terrific shark thriller ""The Shallows"" and seems to have a knack for stripped-down, goal-directed action flicks, has clearly absorbed Alfred Hitchcock films where the action occurs on the boundary separating the real from the metaphorical or dreamlike. The kaleidoscope of humanity that Michael meets on the train is a touch of ""Rear Window,"" the arrangement between him and Farmiga\'s character is a faint echo of ""Strangers on a Train,"" and there\'s a hint of ""North by Northwest"" in the notion of a (mostly) ordinary New Yorker getting pulled into a conspiracy and struggling to regain control over his life. In the end, though, this is a tweedy suburban version of a confined-space action flick. Michael is on his own the whole time. Any allies he picks up along the way are temporary, and not all can be trusted.', "" The class-warfare, eat-the-rich messaging feels rather slapped-on, though, and the movie never gets close to generating the political framework it would have needed to to be taken seriously as a parable of this or that, as opposed to yet another movie where Liam Neeson beats people up. It should be assumed that there are no extraneous scenes in a film like this—by which I mean that, if you meet Michael's ex-partner (Patrick Wilson) and their former supervisor (Sam Neill) early in the story, and get a couple of moments where Michael talks about the economic collapse of 2008, and a scene that ends with Michael giving the finger to a jerkbag of a stockbroker, and one where Michael looks up from a bar to see a TV news story about officials being arrested on corruption charges, you can bet it will all come together in the end, haphazardly. No one involved in the production seemed to think we'd care about clarity when it came to stuff like this. They weren't entirely wrong, but the articulation is still wanting: why even do this kind of politically allegorical action picture if you're not going to, y'know, really do it? Like, with feeling? "", 'I did care very much about Neeson\'s character, though, thanks mainly to his mastery of the same ""just say your lines and hit your marks"" style of film acting. No matter who he\'s playing in these movies, he always attacks the problem at hand with the low-key focus of a guy trying really hard to open a stuck jar of jam. It\'s my considered opinion that Neeson\'s late-career brand of business class dad machismo has yet to meet a director that can fully do it justice, but reasonable minds may differ. In any case, it\'s doubtful that any will be debating the fine points of his late-career filmography when Michael is hanging underneath a moving train like Indiana Jones, or breaking the little glass box at the end of a car so that he can use the hammer on someone\'s skull.

crime "['It’s been a busy old month in front of the TV here at 100 Films HQ, and I’m not even going to cover all of it (I find myself with nothing to say about the five episodes of Arrow and The Flash I watched this month). For some kind of semblance of order to what follows, it’s split into “new stuff” and “old stuff” (plus the usual “other stuff” and “missed stuff” at the end).', '24: Legacy (Season 1 Episodes 1-4)\nPreviously on Twenny-Four… There may be no Jack Bauer, the new font for the clock may be bizarrely wrong, and the on-screen text may have abandoned the familiar golden yellow for a soft blue, but everything else about Legacy is same old, same old. If you remember it from 24, it’s here: the suspicious bosses, the scheming associates, the moles, the people accused of doing something bad who are obviously going to be innocent, the heroes going rogue and having to sneak around under the noses of people who are probably good but can’t be trusted right now, the implausible use and abuse of real-time, the unrelated subplots that are obviously going to be related eventually… even CTU’s ringtone is the same. So too is how it’s directed: split screen is kind of baked into the format, but everything’s hand-held and shot as if people are being spied on. Once upon a time 24’s look was innovative, but that was over 15 years ago. It’s not quite dated looking yet, but it’s no longer slick and modern either. Much like the entire show, to be honest. It’s nothing new, and nor is it a return to form — it’s just more of the same, but without the old leading man. Personally I don’t miss Bauer all that much (for me the format was always the star), but I do lament the complete lack of any attempt at innovation.', 'Broadchurch (Series 3 Episodes 1-3)\nDI David Tennant and DS Olivia Colman (or whatever their characters are called) return after the much-criticised second series for a third run that represents a blazing return to form. Nearly every police drama on TV is always about murder, but here our committed coppers are faced with something that seems harder to prove, and all the more distressing and divisive for those involved: a sexual assault. The series was apparently put together with extensive advice from expert organisations, which means on occasion it almost tips a little too far into factual territory, like a “this is how it’s done in real life” dramatisation. Fortunately screenwriter Chris Chibnall is better than that, quickly focusing on how it affects the characters, and on building the mysteries that will fuel eight whole episodes. Suspicion abounds, but if Broadchurch’s first series proved anything it was that everyone can guess the culprit before the end without it undermining the effectiveness of the drama. I think we’re a ways from that point yet, though…', 'The 89th Academy Awards\nBest. Oscars. Ever! Oh, I bet it was horrendous actually being there having to deal with that ending, but my goodness, as a viewer it was fantastic. It couldn’t’ve been more dramatic if you’d scripted it. Imagine how terrible it could have been, though — if Moonlight had been forced to cede the win to La La Land, for instance (that would’ve sent #OscarSoWhite into overdrive), or if it had been in a category with a sole winner, who in the middle of their no-doubt-tearful acceptance speech was informed they hadn’t won after all and had to embarrassedly hand the statuette over to someone else… But no, it turned out OK. Well, not so for the La La Land guys, but for everyone else, yeah. And the rest of the ceremony wasn’t half bad either. Jimmy Kimmel was the most confident and capable host for bloody ages (and I say that as someone who enjoyed the likes of Neil Patrick Harris and Hugh Jackman) — if the show’s producers know what’s good for them, he’ll be the new regular host.', 'Luther (Series 4)\nThe recent news that Fox have scrapped plans for a US remake of Luther (because they couldn’t find a lead actor good enough to replace Idris Elba) reminded me that I never got round to watching the original version’s last series, this two-parter that aired back in December 2015. I can see why feeling unable to cast anyone as engaging as Elba would lead them to abandon their remake, because there’s not all that much special about Luther outside of its lead. Some people talk about it as if it’s among the forefront of the Quality TV era that we’re currently blessed with, but that’s just a bit daft — much like the programme itself. It doesn’t know it’s daft — it’s all very serious — but it is daft, really. Sure it’s dark, and sometimes kinda scary, and certainly grim, but its realism quotient is way low. It has much more in common with the overblown heightened world of, say, Sherlock than it does with, say, Elba’s previous great TV drama, The Wire. Anyway, the fourth series (if you can call two episodes a series) continues in much the same vein, as Luther’s dragged away from a leave of absence to help track a cannibal serial killer, while also trying to ascertain who committed the supposed murder of his super-villain girlfriend. Yeah, what a grounded and gritty show this is. Still, if you can stomach its gory pessimism, it’s largely entertaining.', 'Peaky Blinders (Series 1)\nI’ve been meaning to get round to this since it first aired back in 2013, and for whatever reason now was the time (partly it was brought to mind by writer Steven Knight’s new dark period drama, Taboo). For thems that don’t know, it’s the saga of the eponymous gang, who ruled the streets of Birmingham in 1919, and their plans for expansion into other forms of business, both legitimate and otherwise. There’s a compelling lead performance from Cillian Murphy as the gang’s feared war veteran leader, but he’s surrounded by a strong ensemble, including the likes of Helen McCrory as his formidable aunt, who ran the business while all the lads were off in the trenches, and Sam Neill as the Northern Irish copper sent to Brum to retrieve some stolen munitions. It functions by turns as both a gripping underworld thriller and character study of violent men, on both sides of the law. I hear future series are of even higher quality, which is something to look forward to indeed.', 'Twin Peaks (Season 1)\n“She’s dead… wrapped in plastic!” With those immortal words (not the first lines, but never mind) a TV phenomenon was born, and a whole new era of television slowly began. Buffy the Vampire Slayer turned 20 this month and the Guardian ran a piece on how it (not, say, The Sopranos or The Wire) was the birth of TV-as-art. I love Buffy, but c’mon — even if we limit ourselves to ongoing US network drama series, Twin Peaks definitely got there first. Leaving aside its place in TV history, it’s a mighty fine drama, with co-creator David Lynch operating at his most accessible, yet still undoubtedly odd, in a story of an ordinary-looking small town with innumerable dark secrets lurking just out of sight. It’s at times hilariously funny, nightmarishly scary, unashamedly trashy, and absolutely gripping. At least so far — season two is notoriously less-good. Well, I’ve never watched it before, so I’ll find out for myself next month.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have mostly been missing the penultimate season of The Americans, which is two episodes in Stateside (no idea if there’s still a UK broadcaster; at this point I’m not sure it matters). Long-time readers may recall I like to save up The Americans and watch it binge-ish-ly once the season ends, which is a very rewarding way to watch such an intricately-constructed programme. The downside is that means I’m still a couple of months away from getting to find out what happens this year in “the best drama on television”. I bet it’ll be good, though.', 'Next month… the final Defender: Iron Fist is released tomorrow. I’ll review it next month (obviously — I mean, this is the “next month” section.) Also!

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Molly Bloom hustles and jostles. She sizzles and dazzles, and whatever room she’s in, she’s totally in command—that is, until she isn’t. Even then, though, she’s irrepressibly verbal—able to articulate everything, all the time, in ways that are far quicker and cleverer than the average human ever could.', 'In other words, Molly Bloom is an Aaron Sorkin character, even though she’s a real person with a really extraordinary tale to tell: The “Poker Princess” made a fortune running high-stakes games for the wealthy and powerful. And “Molly’s Game” marks the directorial debut of the writer of “The West Wing,” “The Social Network” and “A Few Good Men,” among many others. (He’s working from his own screenplay, of course.) So if you’re a fan of his particular brand of impossibly intelligent characters exchanging rat-a-tat dialogue, you’ll be in heaven here. The hose is on full blast for two-plus hours. Nothing and no one seems to be holding him back, for better and for worse.', 'And in Jessica Chastain, Sorkin has found the perfect match for his densely witty repartee. As she’s proven throughout her career—particularly in “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Miss Sloane”—Chastain has the presence, smarts and dexterity to take this kind of tricky material and make it sing. Despite her cynical, detached demeanor, she’s a force of nature in a blowout and a bandage dress—impossible to stop watching and listening to as she narrates giant chunks of “Molly’s Game” in wryly humorous fashion.', 'Sorkin’s film is a bit overlong but it mostly moves briskly, especially off the top, as Molly informs us in a lengthy voiceover about her past as an Olympic-caliber skier and the freak accident that drastically changed her life trajectory. Reminiscent of the variety of ways Adam McKay presented complicated information in “The Big Short,” Sorkin plays with images and graphics, grabbing us with high energy from the very start.', 'Inspired by Bloom’s memoir of the same name, “Molly’s Game” bounces back and forth in time between Molly’s arrest by the FBI for running an illegal gambling operation and her efforts to persuade a New York lawyer (an excellent Idris Elba) to represent her and flashbacks to how she built her glittering empire. Sorkin also goes ever further back to Molly’s youth, when she showed early traces of her independent, rebellious streak by sassing her demanding psychologist dad (a stern Kevin Costner). (As the teenage Molly, Samantha Isler matches up beautifully with Chastain’s voice and demeanor.)', 'To prove her worth and distance herself from the competition of her overachieving brothers, Molly moved to Los Angeles rather than going to law school as she’d originally planned. There she stumbled into organizing a weekly, underground poker game for a would-be Hollywood player (Jeremy Strong) at the “Cobra Lounge”—a stand-in for the Sunset Strip’s infamous Viper Room. Sorkin lets us learn the game right along with Molly—the terminology, the strategy, the psychology. (I’m not a poker expert in the slightest, but people who are tell me “Molly’s Game” gets it right.) A quick study, Molly wrests the game away from him in no time and ups the ante (literally and figuratively) as she glamorously makes it her own. Her transformation is dizzying but Chastain’s confident, grounded nature makes it work.', 'In a rare villainous role, Michael Cera is chilling as a famous actor known as “Player X” (but supposedly based on Tobey Maguire), one of Molly’s earliest regulars who’s more interested in destroying the competition than winning millions for himself. On the other end of the spectrum is a devastating Bill Camp as a decent guy and a strong player who endures a whirlwind series of days in Molly’s high-end hotel suite poker room.', 'But the throughline for all these anecdotes is the strengthening relationship between Molly and her lawyer, the only other person who can consistently match her in the rapid-fire dialogue department. Chastain and Elba have crackling chemistry from the start—you can practically feel the energy of them leaning into each other. Either you’ll be able to give yourself over to Sorkin’s heightened world or you won’t, but the scenes between Chastain and Elba certainly make it easier.', 'Which makes it all the more jarring and unfortunate that both he and Costner’s character end up explaining Molly to Molly when she’s at her lowest point. The scene with Costner is particularly contrived; the redemption it depicts is intended as a much-needed moment of catharsis, but it ends up feeling like smug mansplaining.', 'Ever the fierce competitor, Molly has found a way to rule in a male-dominated world. If only “Molly’s Game” had let her win in the end on her own fascinating, complicated terms.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

Which raises the question: What was the non-weird version?', 'The comics I read as a kid were an unstuck-in-time palimpsest, in which kids with ’70s haircuts and ’50s lifestyles tooled around in Archie Andrews’s ’20s-era jalopy. Recently, the franchise has been redesigned and reconceived. In one series, an adult Archie dies. In another, he and the gang flee an outbreak of zombies, one of whom is his old pal Jughead Jones.', 'The steamy “Riverdale,” which begins Thursday, owes more to those newer iterations. (The showrunner, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, is the chief creative officer of Archie Comics.) It chucks the comics’ old clichés for a new pastiche, drawn from decades of moody teen dramas, that occasionally adds up to something new.', 'The familiar characters are back, as are landmarks like Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe. But it’s a dark, bitter milkshake that “Riverdale” concocts, built on the suspicion that any town this squeaky clean must be hiding decay, corruption and secrets.', 'And jeepers, are there secrets. The big one surrounds the murder of Jason Blossom (Trevor Stines), who disappeared while on an outing in the woods with his mean-girl twin sister Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch). Archie (K. J. Apa) — an aspiring musician with six-pack abs — witnessed a key bit of evidence but can’t talk because of the circumstances: He was hooking up with his music teacher, Ms. Grundy (Sarah Habel), now a sultry knockout.', 'The whole Archieverse is hotter and more haunted. Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), the spellbinding rich girl, is now a transplant from Manhattan whose father is in jail for fraud. Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), still pining away in Archie’s friend-zone, has an older sister who had a breakdown after an entanglement with Jason.', 'It’s a more diverse Riverdale, too, if mainly among the supporting characters. Kevin Keller (Casey Cott), a gay student, was introduced in the recent comics. The mayor, the principal and the girl group Josie and the Pussycats are all African-American. When Archie asks Josie (Ashleigh Murray) if he might write songs for her group, she scolds him for his white privilege, and he soberly concedes her point. Meet our new Archiekins: not just ripped, but woke.', 'The malt shop is still in business, but the drive-in is closing down. The town is beset with bullying, sexual harassment and abuse. Jughead (Cole Sprouse), the wry, burger-munching sidekick of the comics, is now a dour, emo narrator. “Get closer,” he says, “and you start seeing the shadows underneath.”', 'Finding the corrosion under the waxed-and-polished chassis of small-town America is itself an old trope. “Riverdale” flirts with the kinky darkness of David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet,” as well as “Twin Peaks,” whose Mädchen Amick plays Betty’s hard-charging, Adderall-pushing mother. But the series is closer to teen intrigues like “Pretty Little Liars” and “Gossip Girl.”', '“Riverdale” is very conscious of its influences — too much so at times. It’s a blizzard of knowing references and characters talking about one another as characters. “You may be a stock character from a ’90s teen movie,” Cheryl snipes at Veronica, “but I’m not.”', 'She’s right — Cheryl is more like a stock character from “Glee.” Her line is typical of much of the dialogue in “Riverdale”: It’s clever, but it sounds written. Still, the show has a welcome sense of humor about itself.', '“Riverdale” is more an ensemble show than the story of Archie, which is fortunate, because here he’s written and played as a flat, brooding bore. In another touch of meta-casting, he spars with his father, played by Luke Perry, who practically invented soulful teen brooding on “Beverly Hills 90210.”', 'Archie’s gal pals are far more interesting, especially the new, more complex Betty. In the excellent third episode, she and Veronica join forces for a revenge plot against some sex-predator jocks — a theme, lately, in series like MTV’s “Sweet/Vicious.”', 'Ms. Reinhart plays her vigilante turn with a gusto that conveys years of Betty’s repressing her feelings, and the two girls’ bonding complicates their inevitable love triangle with Archie. (That dynamic is very “Dawson’s Creek,” whose Greg Berlanti is an executive producer here.)', 'The early episodes get better the deeper they delve into the murder mystery, despite false notes like members of a biker gang who look like extras from “Grease.”', 'If the tone is not yet consistent, the aesthetic is, a strong sign that “Riverdale” knows what it wants to be. The terrific art direction warps the bubble-gum iconography into something haunting and lurid. Take Archie and the Blossom twins’ hair — so red that it’s clownish, like dyed cotton candy. What the original comics drew as milky and wholesome, “Riverdale” dials up to ghostly and unnatural.', 'The old world of Archie was saccharine, down to the 1969 single by spinoff pop group the Archies, “Sugar, Sugar” (which gets an update in the series from the Pussycats).

crime "['Uneven. Epic. Mind-blowing. Mind-numbingly bad. Conflicting descriptors, for certain, but also applicable to the front half of Arrow’s inaugural season. Some would argue that the ratings speak for themselves. Arrow is one of the CW’s strongest performers. Others would say that it’s a pale imitation of its previous incarnations and wonder where Justin Hartley is. Then, there are those in the middle, like myself, who have seen glimpses of brilliance and believe that the moments where the show falters are simply the program attempting to find its sea legs.', 'Having gone back and re-watched certain episodes, I wondered if my perception would change. Here’s where I find myself:', 'For the most part, the writing for Arrow is strong. It’s structured appropriately, generally well-paced. There were a few episodes (such as “An Innocent Man”) where I felt the show was slightly off-balance or missing a plot beat that would have helped the story flow better, but the writing is solid. Is it going to be winning an Emmy anytime soon? Probably not. But, it’s got punchy dialogue, good rhythm and makes for an enjoyable hour of television (usually)', 'Here is where the show tends to lose its footing: There are two levels of writing – the technical story (aka the boring structure stuff I keep harping on) and the actual storytelling. Something can hit every single expected plot beat and not resonate because the story isn’t compelling. By the same standard, a story can be so compelling that it completely ignores typical formatting. I’ll reference Twilight (the novel) for example. It runs long, it meanders, the plot beats fall about fifty pages outside of where they should be – and it’s one of the more popular books of the century. Why? Because there is something within that babbling mess that readers relate to. Perhaps it’s the feeling of falling in love for the first time, the mystery, the … overuse of the word chagrin. Whatever the case, it inspired millions of people to pick up their eReader of choice, spawned five movies and even got its own line of limited edition cups at Burger King.', 'My point? I have one, I promise. This is where Arrow has yet to forge a unique identity for itself. The front half of the season is like shampooing your hair. Rinse. Lather. Repeat. The show seldom breaks from the, “Someone evil does something evil, Oliver puts on a hood and saves the day” routine. Said Ceena on our forums:', 'The villain of the week must stop.

That is why the fight with the dark archer was such a welcome surprise.', 'In the back half of the season, I hope we see more menacing opponents for Oliver. Perhaps the focus should shift to Malcolm, who has proven to be his most deadly post-Island adversary yet. Added bonus? Tommy/Oliver drama that *gasp* has nothing to do with the world’s most lopsided love triangle. As much as I fangirl Tommy and prefer the teeny-tiny Laurel/Tommy side of that triangle (“I will go down with this ship” ain’t just Dido lyrics, people!), I would much prefer the drama to be more organic. And, what is more dramatic than finding out not only is the vigilante your girl’s lusting after your best friend, but that your dad and he are at odds because your dad’s a creepy criminal?', 'But, that would require actually using the character of Tommy for something other than being a doormat.', 'Laurel is rendered useless by large due to the Tommy/Laurel pairing they insists on having her in.

She fails to impress and the writers just dont feel like writing for her or reduce her time to make the show more bearable.', 'I believe that the writers have done a great job with Thea. She is trying to find her role in the family. Imagine that stress, it could cause some conflicting characters.

That causes someone to look for a reliever and that is where the partying side came in, she realizes that it isn’t the right thing to do and I feel she is trying to change but keeps getting sucked back into her bad ways of the past.

crime "['For those above a certain age, it would be easy to experience  “The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story” as an extended nostalgia parade. The trial of O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, which ran from opening statements in January 1995 to the not-guilty verdicts that October, was inescapable.', 'The sensational details were burned into the brains of anyone who so much as glanced at a TV or tabloid, or talked to someone else who had, during the proceedings. As a result, Mr. Simpson became a pop culture touchpoint, a punch line and, depending on your point of view, either a sinister murderer or a victim of racist police officers set upon taking down one of the most prominent athletes of all time.', 'But this first episode sets up an entirely different framework for the case. Instead of starting with O. J., it opens with footage of Rodney King’s 1991 beating and the next year’s Los Angeles riots, after the officers charged with assaulting him were acquitted. Though previous Ryan Murphy shows have come under fire for how they portray race and sexuality (“Scream Queens” and “The New Normal”), it looks as if this one is going to use a wider lens to discuss race, as well as criminal justice and celebrity.', 'Indeed, a healthy amount of disbelief must be suspended as each character is introduced — they all look like Bizarro World versions of their celebrity selves instead of actors who closely resemble the real people they’re portraying. It definitely took me a few beats to get into the story instead of just staring at everyone’s makeup.', 'After the historical open, we see O. J. (Cuba Gooding Jr.) leaving his mansion late at night and hopping into a limousine, in which he reminisces with the driver about meeting his first celebrity. Already, the show is directing its gaze toward our obsession with fame while also casting doubt on what O. J. was really up to that evening.', 'Even though I feel as though I know this case from top to bottom, there is still suspense in the details. After the police first showed up, I kept asking myself, “Did that really happen?” Did Detective Mark Fuhrman (Steven Pasquale) really hop the gate at O. J.’s Rockingham estate? Is that even legal? Why didn’t the police bring O. J. in right after they found drops of blood on the driver’s side door of his Ford Bronco? Were the kids really able to stay asleep while police officers crawled all over Nicole Brown Simpson’s house, shining flashlights in their faces? Was there really a bowl of melted ice cream on a living room table?', 'The introduction of Kato Kaelin (Billy Magnussen) added some early comedic effect, but the rest of the cast is rolled out in more understated fashion. Sarah Paulson is fantastic as Marcia Clark, the chain-smoking, straight-faced district attorney. (The role is quickly complicated by the fact that she’s a single mother to two boys while also on the cusp of being one of the most widely discussed lawyers of all time.) Clark waves her feminist flag high — she calls out the fact that O. J. has a history of abusing Nicole with no repercussions, and grows increasingly angry as she listens to Nicole’s multiple 911 calls. The fact that O. J.’s fame allowed him to avoid punishment for that abuse only adds fuel to her fire, even if someone initially has to explain to her who O. J. even is.', 'Though the case is familiar, the show finds fertile new ground by focusing heavily on the lawyers’ perspectives and motivations, and their relationships with one another. Clark’s righteous, aggressive personality is offset by Christopher Darden’s (Sterling K. Brown) mild-mannered exhaustion with the broken legal system. The perpetual showboat Johnnie Cochran (Courtney B. Vance) doesn’t even want to be involved in the O. J. case, having already deemed it a lost cause. He’s introduced as a mentor for Darden and a staunch civil rights advocate for African-Americans, but he also has just enough of the sleazy lawyer stereotype in him to make the audience understand how he eventually comes to be a big part of O. J.’s legal “Dream Team.”', 'David Schwimmer is pretty Ross-like as Robert Kardashian, a former lawyer and O. J.’s self-professed best friend who does lots of worried, open-mouth gaping. But he’s a key figure, encouraging O. J. early on to change lawyers after a rogue cameraman catches the star being handcuffed and detained while his current lawyer stands there doing nothing. It’s the cameraman who breaks the news that O. J. is a suspect, which pushes him into a stalking, pill-popping rage that only gets worse when Robert Shapiro (Mr. Travolta) encourages him to take a polygraph test for their own records. O. J. fails miserably, and blames it on his emotional state.', 'Though the prosecution is confident its case against O. J. will be convincing — despite the fact that they can’t “pin him to a version of the story he can’t change later” — the social tide quickly begins to turn when local black radio hosts start to question the racial motivations of the officers involved. At Nicole’s funeral, meanwhile, her conspicuously privileged family and friends whisper and gawk, unable to believe O. J., whom they clearly presume to be guilty, has “the nerve” to show up. There’s a great scene between Kris Jenner (Selma Blair) and Faye Resnick (Connie Britton), dressed in black and gossiping about O. J. like two crows on a telephone wire.', 'Before the trial even started, Mr. Murphy suggests, opinions of the case began to divide along racial lines.', 'When a warrant is issued for O. J.’s arrest, Shapiro talks them into letting O. J. come in on his own instead of having to do a “perp walk,” and this is where all hell breaks loose. O. J., hiding out at Robert Kardashian’s house, holes up in his office to write a series of suicide notes and his will, which he signs with a smiley face. He’s also waving around a gun and maintaining his innocence, with Kardashian pleading with him to please not shoot himself in “Kimmy’s bedroom.” When Al Cowlings (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), known as A.C., shows up, he’s rushed in to help O. J., and by the time the cops arrive to take him in, O. J. has hopped in A.C.’s infamous white Ford Bronco, now careening down the highway.', 'So far I’m impressed, and even though I know how this story ends, I’m interested to see how they’re going to combine facts with conjecture to update the O. J. Simpson story for a new generation.']" "[' Biography', ' Crime', ' Drama']" "American Crime Story"

Crime procedurals aren’t my  bag by a mile, and yet there’s something about “Criminal Minds” that fascinates.  It centers on the Behavioral Analysis Unit (the “BAU”) of the FBI, and each  week it’s their job to get inside the heads of unsavory criminal types and stop  them before they strike again…which often doesn’t happen, as many a death  occurs on their watch before apprehending or taking out the “unsub.” The  easiest way to describe it is as the TV series version of “Silence of the  Lambs,” and it’s almost as grisly. \nWatching this 23-episode box set is a worthwhile endeavor,  but be warned: it may result in serious depression and overall despair where  humanity’s concerned. (Don’t watch it in four days like I did.) “Criminal  Minds” is a really dark show, and it’s a good thing it resides on network  television; if it were on cable, it would be too much to take every week, as no  doubt the ugliness would be amplified tenfold. It’s good where it is, because  the producers and writers are forced to be a little creative with the  presentation. Season Two ups the stakes and drama by frequently focusing on the  personal lives and issues of the BAU and how these people’s personalities both  clash and dovetail with their work. Are they closer to the nutjobs they’re  dedicated to tracking down than they’re comfortable admitting? This seems to be  the underlying theme of the season. \nMandy Patinkin is the BAU’s ace in the hole profiler, Jason  Gideon, a complicated man who loves art, cooking and chess, even as he almost imperceptibly  teeters on the edge of his work. He’s so good at what he does, one wonders  about the darkness inside the man. Thomas Gibson plays Aaron “Hotch” Hotchner,  the guy in charge of the unit. Hotch is the straight man, and Gibson may have  the toughest job on the show, but you wouldn’t guess it by watching his  performance. My adoration for Gibson’s talents goes way back, and I continue to  admire his work here because playing the humorless boss isn’t an easy task, yet  one never gets the impression that Gibson is anything but totally at ease  allowing his co-stars to have the most colorful storylines. (At the time of writing,  Patinkin/Gideon has left “Criminal Minds” and Joe Mantegna will be showing up  shortly to take his place. Hopefully, Gibson will be given more meat in Season  Three; not only can he handle it, but he deserves it.)\n\nThe box set opens with “The Fisher King, Part 2,” the  conclusion to the first season’s cliffhanger involving yet another vicious  whack job who knows just a little too much about each member of the BAU. In  Part 1, Agent Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini, “The Sopranos”) was shot and  looked to be dead; here, it’s revealed that she’s actually just on the brink,  and parts of the episode take place in a between-life-and-death netherworld.  Without revealing too much, suffice it to say that Greenaway is not long for  the BAU world, but her story is not as simple as living or dying; Elle’s arc is  the first that shows Season Two is going for a different kind of procedure. The  other three episodes that round out Disc 1 are an accurate cross-section of  exactly how disturbing this show can be: a child is put up for sale via a  24-hour Internet auction, a pair of sadistic killers torture, rape and kill  women and then send video recordings of the sessions to the victim’s  families, and, finally, a robber holds banks hostage and forces strangers to  undress and have sex with each other for his gratification. Yeah, “Criminal  Minds” is disconcerting, to put it mildly. Hopefully, the actors and behind the  camera talent find distractions between takes to forget about the darkness they  collectively weave each week. (I’m convinced Patinkin’s abrupt exit had to do  with playing such unsettling material every day.)\nIt would be a disservice to the show to say the rest of the  season consists of variations on the same theme. Yes, in some ways it is, yet  the writers do a bang-up job of keeping the surprises coming, and each episode  leaves the viewer wondering, “How many different kinds of psychos do we have in  our world?” It’s a credit to the show that it rarely repeats itself. “The Last  Word” (2.9) has two serial killers operating in the same geographic area (and  trying to outdo one another). “Empty Planet” (2.8) features a guy whose M.O. is  inspired by a science fiction novel. “Lessons Learned” (2.10) boldly – and  responsibly -- tackles Islamic terrorism. “North Mammon” (2.7), a season  standout, has three teenage girls abducted and placed into a cellar; they are  told, “Two of you can leave when one of you is dead,” with the idea being that  they must decide not only which one will die but which two are capable of  killing. It’s a horrific concept with a gobsmacking ending (on several levels)  that would’ve made for a fine feature film…and that leads us to a couple  criticisms of the series.\nThis show could really benefit from doing more in-depth  two-parters. The cases often feel as if they’re resolved too quickly, which can  lead to that familiar “TV” vibe. On the other hand, the two-parters here are  designed less to offer up multifaceted cases and more to serve deeper  explorations of the core characters. “The Big Game” and “Revelations” (2.14  & 2.15) are actually a disguised two-parter, since they aren’t labeled as being connected. At the end  of the first, a schizophrenic serial killer – James Van Der Beek of “Dawson’s Creek” in an  outstanding turn – kidnaps BAU Agent Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler),  while the follow-up is a psychological game between the two -- or three or  four, given the material -- as a tortured and drugged-up Reid uses his  knowledge of schizophrenia (his mother suffers from it) to stay alive. It’s no  mean feat to deliver the kind of dialogue Reid’s frequently given without  sounding like a smartass, but Gubler always accomplishes it with great ease and  humility. He’s often the show standout, and from “Revelations” to the end of  the season, his character grows increasingly complex due to the fallout from  the kidnapping. The rest of the cast -- Shemar Moore, A.J. Cook, Kirsten  Vangsness and midseason newcomer Paget Brewster – is each as sharp as those  already mentioned; there isn’t a weak performer in the BAU ensemble.\n\nSeason Two’s other two-parter is oddly split up between  episode 13 and the finale, 23. It’s some crazy, over-the-top madness featuring  Keith Carradine as a serial killer named Frank who’s been deftly operating  across the U.S.  for over 30 years. Gideon encounters him in a diner in the middle of the Nevada desert in the  first installment. When they meet again at season’s end, it’s a showdown  between hunter and hunted...but who’s hunting who at this point? The Frank  storyline sees the show almost drifting into comic book territory, but Patinkin  and Carradine save it through fine acting. It’d be unfair to say it’s anything  less than entertaining, but “Criminal Minds” needs to be a little more  judicious with its season finales; it may be at its weakest when it resorts to  such theatrics. Indeed, episode 22, “Legacy,” features a villain/story just  ambitious enough to have been prime finale fodder.\nBut perhaps I’m in the wrong to call aspects of the approach  into question. The producers and writers deserve major kudos for developing a  strategy for keeping the show on the air without dumbing it down, and the  second season of “Criminal Minds” sets a higher bar for this type of network  series. It’s compelling psychological crime drama that offers up mostly standalone  stories, while simultaneously infusing quiet character arcs along the way for  faithful viewers. As with many series these days, it comes as no surprise that  the episode presentation here is crystal clear and in 16 x 9. \nSpecial Features:  Four episodes (“The Fisher King, Part 2”, “The Perfect Storm,” “Profiler,  Profiled,” and “Revelations”) sport informative commentary tracks from various  members of the cast and crew. In listening to them, it’s clear how much the  people working on this show enjoy what they do. Disc Six offers up four  featurettes: “Profilers, Profiled” is a series of interviews with selected  talent, including Patinkin, Gubler, Moore, and executive producer Edward Allen  Bernero; “The Physical Evidence” takes a look at what the creative team has  done to make the show different for Season Two; “Behavioral Science: Real-Life  Criminal Minds” is a look at how accurate the show may or may not be; and “Meet  Kirsten Vangsness” is a whimsical meet and greet with the actress who plays  Penelope Garcia, a character that brings the show much needed comic relief.  Speaking of which, there’s a gag reel, which is more amusing than the norm  given the show’s seriousness, and two deleted scenes. Lastly, it must be  mentioned that Disc One kicks off with a mesmerizing, salivate-over-this upcoming-release  trailer for “Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold  Box Edition,” which streets on Oct. 30th. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can follow us on Twitter and Facebook for content updates.

However, if you think about it, the arrival of “Bright” makes perfect sense.

If you’re thinking, “oh, no, this means we’re going to get a lot of really basic lessons about understanding other races through a genre lens,” you’re not wrong! It’s mere minutes before Will Smith’s Officer Ward says “Fairy lives don’t matter,” and we’re treated repeatedly to paper-thin parallels between this world and our own. You see, Officer Ward has a partner that nobody likes named Jacoby (Joel Edgerton, easily the best thing about this movie). Why don’t they like him? He’s an orc, and they don’t trust that he won’t side with his people over his profession. In fact, everyone is convinced he recently did so after an orc shot Ward and escaped while Jacoby was chasing him. Over and over again, Landis treats us to a truly vague commentary on\xa0racism through the lens of “orc-ism.” And to give you an idea of how muddied and unclear this allegory is, Ward asks Jacoby “Are you a cop first or an orc first,” as we’re watching cops beat orcs in the street. Huh? Does he have to be a bad cop first? I don’t get it. And I don’t think that the movie does either, other than to show that there's something that looks like a centaur cop involved in the beating. Neat.\xa0"", 'On one long night in this magical land (Ayer loves his one-night movies), Ward and Jacoby stumble upon a magic wand because, well, why not?\xa0As you might imagine,\xa0wands are powerful currency in this world as\xa0they can make the impossible possible. They’re kind of the “one ring” of “Bright.” But only a “bright”—yes, the name actually refers to something in the film, not just how clever the filmmakers think their concept is—can hold a wand without exploding. Still, everyone wants the wand, and so Jacoby, Ward, and a new friend named Tikka (Lucy Fry),\xa0who is basically the result of Landis saying “How can we get a character like Milla Jovovich’s from “The Fifth Element” into this movie,” have to fend off corrupt cops, the feds (including a wasted Edgar Ramirez), and a powerful group of elves who lost the wand in the first place, led by an evil Noomi Rapace.   ', 'Smith, Edgerton, Rapace—it’s a decent crew, and the concept could have been developed into something intriguing if Landis wasn’t so in love with it that he forgot to write decent dialogue. The banter here is insanely sophomoric, caught between Ayer’s “realistic cop movie” aesthetic and the comic book movie that Landis wanted to make. Nonsense lines like “If you act like my enemy … you become my enemy,” will merely have you scratching your head and wondering if anyone read the script before they approved the budget or if they just so adored the concept\xa0that they didn’t care. Clearly, this is the kind of exaggerated nonsense—“this is a nuclear weapon that grants wishes” and ""that\'s when the triple stupid shit is gonna start""\xa0being two more primo bits of stuff that only work if you\'re high—that could have been effective with a director like Robert Rodriguez to inject it with enough style to make it tolerable. The fatal flaw really is that\xa0Ayer and Landis don’t seem to be making the same movie, although I’m not sure too many people could make the fantasy world of this flick and the action/buddy-cop movie blend. It’s an absolute mess.   ', 'It all culminates in an extended scene that’s basically the interrogation/torture scene out of those ‘80s and ‘90s buddy action movies only this time people are screaming “Where is the wand” over and over again for what honestly feels like eternity. It’s a scene that stands with the worst of the year in terms of structure and screenwriting, and it’s where any hope that “Bright” might bring its bizarre elements together faded completely for me. I started to think of the worst summer blockbusters of 2017 like “Transformers: The Last Knight,” “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,” and “The Mummy,” and I realized how easily this ridiculous waste of money fit in with those crowd-displeasers. They may have been doing so in terms of quality filmmaking before, but “Bright” proves how much Netflix truly is running with the big dogs now.\xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

crime "['The set, inside the cavernous studio on Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, is meant to represent the bunkerlike headquarters of a polished Chinese techno-gangster who has a relationship with the criminal mastermind Raymond Reddington, now — for murky reasons unknown to both the gangster and the audience — aligned with the F.B.I.', 'Reddington, the main character in the coming and much-anticipated new NBC drama “The Blacklist,” is, at this moment, wearing a light-green short-sleeved shirt and brown walking shorts. He looks more like a U.P.S. delivery man than the scourge of American law enforcement. Then again, it’s only rehearsal, and James Spader has his Reddington intensity dialed down to zero, in favor of his normal, real-life mode of free-associating bonhomie.', 'That is the quality that comes through in his enthusiasm for this new starring role: “The possibilities of this show are limitless,” he says, excitement pitched in his voice. “Anybody can be on the blacklist. Ha, ha, ha! Anybody!”', 'No new network drama enters the season with higher expectations — or more pressure — than “The Blacklist.” The show has won wide praise from critics and was the most talked about show during the last development season in Hollywood. And, to be blunt, NBC needs a hit. The network has slotted it in the best spot on its schedule, Mondays at 10 p.m., after its top-rated show, “The Voice.” A lot is riding on this series and Mr. Spader’s eye-catching performance.', 'A few minutes after rehearsal, in a gray herringbone suit and vest, hair skimmed close to his scalp, Mr. Spader is in full Reddington mode, jousting with his Chinese nemesis with weary disdain, delivering lines of complicated dialogue with precision — through 12 long takes.', 'One reason for all the repetition: Mr. Spader’s new co-star, Megan Boone, who plays Reddington’s foil in the series, a young F.B.I. agent named Liz Keen, is not as sure-footed in the scene. Of course, Ms. Boone, perhaps best known for the short-lived “Law & Order: Los Angeles,” hasn’t been acting in movies, television and theater for 35 years as Mr. Spader has.', '“Would you say Spader is kind of an enigma?” Ms. Boone muses later in her dressing room. “He’s very unexpected. He’s very kind and considerate. But then you also don’t ever feel 100 percent comfortable.”', 'All of which makes James Spader the ideal choice for Reddington, a character intended to fascinate and mystify. In the opening episode, to be shown on Monday night, Reddington gives himself up to the F.B.I., offering to help capture a host of known and unknown supercriminals — on just one condition: that he work with Liz Keen, a woman he seemingly has had no prior connection to. Even Mr. Spader doesn’t want to know too much about the reasons for all that.', '“As long as the show continues to be enigmatic, it has its compulsion,” Mr. Spader said. “I need to know a little bit more than the viewer, but I don’t want to know more than that.”', 'Jon Bokenkamp, one of the executive producers of “The Blacklist,” said that in conversations with another producer, John Fox, they pictured a Keyser Soze, the mysterious villain of the film “The Usual Suspects.” Mr. Bokenkamp pointed out that Reddington tells the F.B.I.: “Don’t trust me. Everything about me is a lie.”', 'The script for the “Blacklist” was, Mr. Spader says, intriguing in ways that got his attention. “It was to be shot in New York,” he noted, which he considers home. And then there was that character. There is, he said, his eyes widening with delight, “a lot of room for me to move around in there.”', 'Mr. Spader has always been an actor who looks to expand boundaries. His career has ranged from memorable teenagers (“Pretty in Pink”) to provocative bad boys (“Sex, Lies and Videotape”) to acclaimed television lawyers. He won three Emmy Awards for playing the character Alan Shore in two series, “The Practice” and “Boston Legal.” Along the way he acquired a reputation for quirky, idiosyncratic performances of eccentric characters.', 'Now 53 and no longer in possession of the wavy locks that were his early signature, Mr. Spader remains in demand for more mature quirky, idiosyncratic performances.', 'Coming off “Boston Legal,” Mr. Spader was at loose ends — and broke, he said, because he spent all his television money “on new households, families, new lives and all that.” Movies held little appeal, either in roles or compensation. Then David Mamet approached him about his play “Race,” slated for a Broadway run.', 'But, “after that I was really broke,” he said. While looking for work, an offer came in unexpectedly to make a one-time appearance on “The Office.” That went so well, the NBC comedy pitched a regular role the next season.', 'At the same time Mr. Spader got a call from Steven Spielberg offering a juicy role — the prototype lobbyist William Bilbo — in his long-delayed film “Lincoln.” But that work was eight months away. “I didn’t want to stiff him,” Mr. Spader said of Mr. Spielberg, “if all of a sudden something came along to pay the mortgage.”', 'He was saved by the producers of “The Office,” who said he could take a break from the comedy to make the movie, a prestige project he was eager to be part of. After he wrapped his season on “The Office,” a flood of new pilot scripts arrived, among which “The Blacklist” stood out.', 'It came with a somewhat odd instruction from the producers: Don’t get the impression this project borrows too heavily from a famous film.', 'That impression has been mentioned often in connection with “The Blacklist,” because a host of its essential elements are strikingly reminiscent of “Silence of the Lambs.” These would include the central dangerous criminal, captured, shackled and put in a boxlike cage, who will speak only with one young female F.B.I. agent.', 'Both Mr. Spader and Ms. Boone acknowledged that the pilot suggests “Silence,” mainly in its imagery: those shackles for example. But Reddington is no serial killer, not even a psychopath, though “he might be a little crazy,” Mr. Spader conceded.', 'Mr. Bokenkamp argued that Reddington shares almost nothing with the “Silence” man-eating villain, Hannibal Lecter. “On the other hand,” he said, “If you have to be compared to something, you might as well be compared to something great.”', 'Though it definitely makes Mr. Spader happy, “The Blacklist” is being shot in New York mainly because the city can double for almost anywhere else, Mr. Bokenkamp said, and the producers intend to create scenes around the world, as Reddington and Liz capture what the staff calls “the Bond villain of the week.” Ms. Boone noted, “We have already turned Barrow Street into Montreal and Queens into Shanghai.”', 'Ideally “The Blacklist” would grab some of the magic of the recent spate of great dramas on cable television by emphasizing serial elements like the continuing mysteries of Reddington’s motivation and Liz’s past while at the same time following network procedural tradition by catching “the bad guy of the week,” as Mr. Bokenkamp put it.', 'But there is little doubt the show’s spotlight will fall on Mr. Spader. He wants the idiosyncrasies doled out carefully. “I’ve hammered into the producers as much as I can,” he said, that “too much of him will be like too much ice cream.”', '“You really want to watch him,” Ms. Boone said, then added, “He does play the overly confident, egomaniacal, morally ambiguous guy really well.”', ""A version of this article appears in print on September 22, 2013, on Page AR15 of the New York edition with the headline: Crafty Character.

A fellow reviewer and I were discussing the timing given by the IMDb and we both thought, no way can this probably relatively dinky cops-and-robbers picture be almost two and a half hours. But it is.', '“Den of Thieves” opens with some text explaining just how many bank robberies occur in Los Angeles California over the span of one year—broken down by months, days, hours, and minutes. Having rolled out the stats, and they are impressive, the text concludes that “Los Angeles in the bank robbery capital of the world.” Already one feels the movie, co-written and directed by Christian Gudegast, is doing some kind of special pleading. There are four million stories in this naked city, and not all of them can be “Heat,” but this one is KINDA like that, okay?', 'Indeed, the movie begins with crime that’s committed like a paramilitary operation. An armored car stops at a donut place and an SUV full of masked men armed to the teeth swoop in on it. A dropped coffee sets off a trigger-happy heist man, and a near-massacre ensues. This crew didn’t want it that way, but as its mastermind, Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) glumly notes when they’ve gotten to safety, “Now we’re cop-killers.” And they did it all for an empty truck.\xa0', 'That’s one of the things that Gerard Butler’s “Big” Nick Davis, the major crimes cop on the scene, has to figure out. He runs a half-rogue crew he calls “The Regulators,” and they’re not above kidnapping and torturing suspected perps to get their men. Butler, sporting a slightly unruly beard, plays the role as if he’s imitating Mel Gibson during his drunk driving arrest. He’s crude, boorish, and cavalier. Genre mavens will see where Gudegast, who wrote Butler’s last film, “London Has Fallen” and is making his feature directorial debut here, is pulling his threads from. The Neal/Vincent dynamic of “Heat” isn’t duplicated here; it’s more like the Chance/Masters dynamic in “To Live And Die In L.A.,” in which cop and criminal dealt in the same kind of corruption but the criminal was ultimately the more ethically pure of the two. Thing is, though, “Den of Thieves” never really gets that deep, and turns out not to be all that terribly serious a movie anyway. The various character dynamics are almost a smokescreen for a convoluted heist targeting the only bank in Los Angeles that has never been robbed: the branch of the Federal Reserve where, among other things, old money is destroyed around the same time as the serial numbers attached to it are erased.\xa0', 'The plot thickens ...\xa0and thickens ...\xa0and thickens. Gudegast is clearly an avid student of heist pictures, and he layers this one with a lot of spectacular complications even while he muddles the average viewer’s potential rooting interest. As charismatic as Schreiber’s gangleader and the criminal lieutenant played by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson can be (Gudegast engineers a scene involving Jackson’s character’s daughter going on a prom date for a comic-relief “dad gives the date a talking to” scene), they’re still guys who blew away almost a dozen cops in the opening scene, so the suspense when they’re finally inside the Fed building and almost pulling things off is potentially slightly compromised. As for Butler’s Nick, yeah, he’s consistently asking for a spanking to say the least. But where Gudegast really shows his hand, if you’re in the mood to stay ahead of this movie, is in the casting. There’s one character, played by an actor of star-quality charisma, who keeps getting put off to the side in the story, and you have to wonder why. Once you’ve decided why, you can figure out at least one of the twists. And of course, the actor, who I won’t name, is winning enough that you suddenly understand exactly where your rooting interest was supposed to have been all along.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

crime "['Netflix’s first original German series, Dark, will inevitably be compared to Stranger Things. Both series focus on children who have gone missing; both are set, partially in Dark’s case, in the 1980s; both involve unexplained phenomena that cause lights to flicker, among other things; and both reveal underground pathways that connect to a mysterious facility that’s key to the show’s central mysteries. In Stranger Things, that facility is Hawkins Lab, where scientists have engaged in studies reminiscent of the CIA’s MK-Ultra experiments. In Dark, it’s a nuclear power plant, a nod to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which looms over the series in multiple ways.', 'But Dark, now streaming and presented with English subtitles, is tonally quite different from that show about Dustin and his pet Demogorgon. As laid out by co-creators Baran bo Odar, a Swiss filmmaker, and German screenwriter Jantje Friese, its moods and hues are much more in line with the original French version of The Returned. Every day in Winden, the small German town where Dark takes place, is as gray and overcast as the moods of its characters.', 'There are a lot of characters to keep track of, which is one of the key challenges in the initial episodes that inevitably suck you in regardless. The show opens with a voice-over explaining that “everything is connected,” which turns out to be true of the relationships between the parents and children in four families that are slowly introduced. First we meet Jonas (Louis Hofmann), a teenager who has spent time in a mental hospital following his father’s suicide and is readjusting to regular life in 2019 when he learns that a classmate, Erik, has gone missing.', 'A short time later, Jonas and several friends go on a late-night expedition into the Winden woods to see if they can recover some drugs that Erik stashed away in a hiding spot. In the process, a friend’s younger brother, Mikkel (Daan Lennard Liebrenz) disappears. Mikkel happens to be the sibling of Jonas’s ex-girlfriend, and also the son of the police chief, who happens to be having an affair with Jonas’s mother, and I could keep writing this sentence and explaining the web of overlapping relationships in this town, but you get the idea.', 'With the caveat that it’s best to enter Dark as spoiler-free as possible, I won’t say too much about the role that 1986 plays in the series, other than to say that the drama between its men, women, boys, and girls toggles back and forth between that year and 2019, in ways that support the Albert Einstein quote that flashes onscreen in the pilot: “The distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”', 'If this all sounds cryptic, that’s because it is. Dark is a mystery-box show through and through, complete with secrets and surprising twists and cliffhangers that put a cap on each episode while enticing you to immediately open the bottle of the next one. It is such a mystery-box show that it even features a box, containing the suicide note written by Jonas’s father, and takes several episodes to actually reveal what the letter says. While that might sound frustrating, the thicket of storylines is so intricate that there’s no time to get annoyed when one piece of information takes a while to reveal itself. There are too many other elements of the puzzle to continue trying to sort out.', 'Like other shows that invite the viewer to try to solve them, Dark suffers a bit in the humanity department. With so many characters and such attention on how their identities and actions fit into the plot, there isn’t much room to truly get to know these people on a deeper level, at least not in the six episodes that I watched out of the ten total.', 'The overall vibe is so heavy that watching Dark can be a bit suffocating at times. I’ll also note that this show has never met a portentous moment that it couldn’t make more portentous by unleashing the sound of extremely ominous-sounding strings. If you’re looking for something that’s going to lighten your spirits at the end of a rough week, this isn’t it. But if you enjoy complex mysteries that embrace a sense of melancholy and never let go of it — think not just The Returned, but also The Killing or season one of Top of the Lake — this will be right up your creepy alley and/or shadowy gravel road in the middle of nowhere.', 'To be fair, every once in a while Dark does exhibit a flash of oddball humor. In the third episode, a medical technician is performing an autopsy on one of several recently expired sheep and chatting with the chief inspector. After announcing that the sheep’s eardrums have ruptured as he examines the fleecy corpse, the technician casually asks: “Coming to our party this weekend? My wife’s making Yugoslavian meatballs.”', 'It’s a welcome gruesomely playful moment and one that, yet again, calls to mind another TV series about missing teens in a small town where things just ain’t right.

Yet Screen Gems was hiding the movie from critics as if it were a drunk frat boy trying to crash a classy black-tie soiree.', '“Proud Mary” doesn’t deserve the lack of faith its studio has in it. In fact, it’s\xa0almost\xa0good, so close to success that its flaws truly become frustrating. Those flaws are all behind the camera, starting with the awful cinematography by Dan Laustsen. I haven’t seen a movie this obsessed with light coming through venetian blinds since 1984. The light is so distracting that it blots out Danny Glover’s entire face during his best scene. Much has been written about Hollywood’s inability to light Black skin, but considering that Laustsen also shot “Mimic” and “The Shape of Water,” I must conclude that his lighting here is a misguided stylistic choice.', 'The editing is also problematic, as action scenes (and even dramatic ones) too often end several beats too soon. The cadences are off-putting and rushed; numerous times the acting or the action was so involving that I wanted to spend more time within the scenes. Screenwriters Steve Antin, John Stuart Newman and Christian Swegal put in more drama than one might expect for a standard actioner, but the capable actors are undermined by the film’s construction. Director Babak Najafi manages to correct the pacing issue during the admittedly excellent action climax, but it’s too little, too late.', ""Whenever “Proud Mary” falters, the extremely talented Henson picks the film up and carries it on her capable shoulders like a wounded comrade. Just watching her from scene to scene is pure joy. Henson is an actress whose performances manifest themselves in her entire body. Here, she plays a tough hitwoman whose unexpected maternal instinct comes with a heaping side order of guilt. These conflicting feelings seem to emanate from her soul. Watch how she temporarily melts in the arms of a former lover before coming to her senses, or how she holds her head when she tells her orphaned young ward Danny (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) what to do in case of her demise. Or how she nonchalantly blows people away with the coolness of Schwarzenegger or Stallone. Her parental arguments with Danny are also delivered with expert comic timing and she’s savvy enough to know when to let Winston steal the scene. One senses this was a passion project of hers because she’s fully committed even when the film lets her down."", 'In addition to Winston, whose lack of precociousness is refreshing, “Proud Mary” also has good performances by Billy Brown, who plays the aforementioned love interest and Danny Glover, whose Godfather-like character marks his return to bad guy roles. The best parts of “Proud Mary” are the moments when the film investigates the complicated emotional contracts between its characters. Much of Mary’s story entails her attempts to hide betrayals from the people she cares for, especially where Danny is concerned. Danny’s father is the first hit we see Mary perform, and her guilt at leaving him parentless weighs on her conscience almost as much as the fear that Danny will figure out her connection to him. When Benny spills the beans about Mary to Danny, Glover superbly plays the moment like a more charming Bill Sykes from Oliver Twist.', '“Proud Mary” has enough going for it that one wishes for an “All the Money in the World”-style do-over: Replace the cinematographer with Ernest Dickerson, perhaps, and the editor with the folks from “Baby Driver.” Alas, that future won’t come to pass. I am giving a mild thumbs down here, but if you’re a fan of Ms. Henson, don’t let me stop you from seeing this.

crime "['A slightly earlier than normal TV review this month, to get ahead of all the Christmas telly — but there’s still plenty to discuss…', 'The Punisher \xa0Season 1\nThe fourth live-action iteration of Frank Castle, Marvel’s murderous anti-hero (and people moan about Spider-Man reboots), debuted in Daredevil season two and was greeted so positively that now he’s got his own spin-off series. And “spin-off” is not an inaccurate descriptor, because this very much launches out of the events of Frank’s storyline in Daredevil — which makes it all the more annoying that Netflix care not for “previously on”s: Daredevil season two was over 18 months ago; a little refresher would be nice.', 'You see, the plot revisits the Punisher’s origins: his family were killed in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out, leading him to kill the criminals responsible. He thinks that mission is complete, but the season begins (more or less) with him discovering new intel that suggests his family’s murder may not have been so random, and it links back to his actions when he was in the military. This also serves as a launchpad for the series to tackle other war-related issues, primarily the psychological wellbeing of veterans. With such serious themes it’s perhaps no surprise that there’s very little here that’s outright comic-book-y here — no superpowers, for sure; not even veiled references to the big names of the MCU movies, which we’ve had in every other Marvel Netflix show. In fact, if it weren’t for the fact the series is so obviously spun out of Daredevil and has the Marvel logo at the start, you could be forgiven for thinking it wasn’t a Marvel show at all.', 'Some people think this removes the Punisher’s USP. In and of himself he’s just a violent man out for revenge — action cinema is stuffed to bursting with such anti-heroes. What makes Frank unique is he’s that kind of character but in a world where super-powered and super-moral people exist. So would The Punisher have been more interesting if, instead of a very grounded military conspiracy storyline, it had something to do with Frank clashing with superpowered people? I don’t know. It certainly would’ve been a different show. As it stands, this may be a show for people who don’t typically like Marvel shows. So was Jessica Jones before it, but this is for different people who don’t like Marvel shows — people like Jason Statham, maybe.', 'In the title role, Jon Bernthal is fantastic. You can absolutely believe him as a revenge-driven psychopath capable of killing anyone and everyone, but also as a kind-of-charming strong-but-silent type with a heart and moral code who will definitely do the right thing. I’ve seen some critics and viewers opine that now is the wrong time for a series about a hero who just murders indiscriminately. I say those people definitely haven’t watched this Punisher. Although the plot is a conspiracy thriller, the series invests a lot of time in the emotional world of Frank Castle, making him human and moral rather than just a single-minded murder-machine. Bernthal makes what could be a very one-note role into a plausible human being; one who you believe might be able to find redemption and leave someday. And maybe that makes him even more tragic — he could find it; it’s possible… but likely? There’s the rub. As it’s also trying to engage with issues facing combat veterans once they return home, it makes for a clearly different, more serious flavour for an MCU production. How successfully it explores these weighty issues is more debatable.', 'Many of these Marvel shows take their whole first season to fully complete the hero’s origin story, but The Punisher is stuck with the fact that Castle already became The Punisher during his Daredevil appearance. So do they just ignore that story shape? No, of course they don’t — they shift it on to the villain! Therefore any comic book fan who knows what one character will ultimately become (no spoilers here!) is constantly teased with possibilities throughout the season until, eventually, as we should’ve known from the start, the transformation occurs in the finale. Why not really surprise us: do the transformation earlier and then wrap a character up within one season, rather than leaving them dangling for a possible next time? Comic books have to leave things dangling — they will all run for ever and ever; there can be no permanent solutions — but these TV series will end — whether it’s after a single season, or two, or five, or ten, they are without exception finite. That means you’re allowed to wrap a character up and move on to others.', 'So, The Punisher is not an unmitigated success, but it does lend another flavour to the Marvel-Netflix landscape. I certainly hope we get to see more of Bernthal’s take on the character in the future.', 'Detectorists \xa0Series 3 Episodes 2-6\nThe third and final series of BBC Four’s sitcom about a couple of mates whose hobby is metal detecting was every bit the equal of the first two runs, which saw the show place on my list of 10 Favourite TV Series of the Last 10 Years back in February. Its brilliance lies in how perfectly weighted it is: the characters are quirky, but also normal; their problems are grounded and realistic, without being glum and unduly serious; it’s frequently hilarious, but without slipping into gurning ‘Comedy’ territory; it’s kind and gentle, but without being dull; and it’s all very lovely and kind-hearted, without being twee or saccharine. It’s also beautifully put together by writer-director (and star) Mackenzie Crook — the storyline across the series was precisely constructed, and the photography is often a gorgeous showcase for the English countryside. A real gem that will be missed, though at least it came to a perfect conclusion.', 'The Good Place \xa0Season 1 Episodes 3-13\nI only heard about this after its Big Twist was much-discussed online, so starting it was an exercise in knowing there was a big reveal awaiting. Fortunately, that knowledge doesn’t overshadow everything that comes before it. For those who still aren’t aware of it (especially as it’s only on Netflix on this side of the pond), it’s about a woman (Kristen Bell) who dies and goes to Heaven only due to an admin error, so she tries to better herself so that she’s deserving of her place. Other complications emerge as the season goes on, but that’s the premise. There’s a lot of plot for a sitcom — although it’s not necessarily immediately obvious, it tells a 13-episode story; this makes Netflix quite a natural home for it, actually, as it’s not your typical “every episode is fundamentally standalone” sitcom. But it’s also very funny in amongst all that, mining not only the characters and their foibles, but also the uncommon situation they’ve found themselves in. The shocker in the finale is just the icing on the cake. I hear season two has gone off the boil somewhat, but I’ll find out for myself once it’s all wrapped up.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have been missing so much stuff.

The writers had to accommodate the departure of one of the show’s lead actors, Josh Charles, so they killed off his character, Will Gardner, who among other things was an on again-off again love interest for the title character, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies). And it’s a measure of the writers’ dexterity that even that unexpected twist didn’t rock the show’s metabolism.', '“SVU,” on NBC, has already dealt with many departures, including that of a star, Christopher Meloni, in 2011. Despite new cast members, “SVU” chose this season to boost momentum and amp its ratings by putting Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) at the mercy of a homicidal rapist — twice. And that stretch was less fortuitous, a sign that this show, which has been renewed for a 16th season, is running out of gas.', '“The Good Wife” made the best of an unsought development and finished the season with a happier surprise: Sunday’s episode ended with Alicia contemplating her own run for public office, as state’s attorney, the same office her husband held when his extramarital affairs were revealed and he was forced to resign.', 'On Wednesday, this season of “SVU” will come to an end after a harrowing story arc that moved Benson into the victim’s chair, kidnapped and brutalized by a psychopath (Pablo Schreiber) who escaped from prison to capture and torture her all over again.', 'Even the most formulaic cop shows eventually turn inward and mine the personal lives of characters for added drama, and “SVU” is no exception. But this story line was more troubling.', 'It’s not the first time the show has put Olivia on the precipice of being sexually assaulted; in this case, her tormentor was a sadist who has raped numerous women but doesn’t cross the line with Olivia. The writers may have felt that viewers couldn’t stomach that outcome for a beloved and strong female character. Yet by going so far into the experience and then pulling back, they may also be sending the very message that the show was intended to combat: that rape is a degradation beyond all others and cannot be overcome.', 'Alicia’s brush with violence was not nearly as extreme, but it was also formative. When the series began in 2009, she was a passive stay-at-home wife whose life was torn apart by her husband’s scandal. Year after year Alicia, having returned to practicing law, has grown more assertive, self-sufficient and duplicitous — she is at times as cunning as some of her more unscrupulous colleagues. The death of Will was a loss that didn’t destroy her. If anything, it helped her stand up to her husband, Peter (Chris Noth), and live her own life.', 'Most important, the departure of Mr. Charles didn’t drain the show of its energy or sizzle, and that alone is an accomplishment. It’s always difficult to dispatch a popular character, but writers came up with an unusually deft way to do it. For most viewers, it was truly a shock when Will was killed in a courtroom shooting; it was even more shocking that the denouement didn’t leak ahead of time. The shooting, however unexpected, was well set up, with a defendant who gradually unravels before losing his mind and grabbing a gun.', 'The story didn’t instantly move on after Will’s death. Alicia and other friends and colleagues grieved in stages, but sorrow didn’t snuff out the lawyers’ ambitions, rivalry and paranoia: Office politics on that show have turned as convoluted and ruthless as the electoral politics in the governor’s office.', '“The Good Wife” is both a drama about Alicia’s personal life and a classic courtroom procedural, and keeps its balance. “SVU,” a spinoff of the original “Law & Order,” began as a procedural but over time mined the drama in the personal lives of its detectives, and sometimes strayed too far from its mandate.', ""A version of this article appears in print on May 19, 2014, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: 2 Heroines Braving Challenges.

(The two Plummers are not related, incredibly.)\xa0', '“All the Money in the World” is brutal and funny in the darkest way. The dark humor comes from John Paul Getty’s attitude toward his fortune. He’s so miserly he makes Ebenezer Scrooge look generous. Naturally, he’s the real target here; he would have to be, considering Gail is just another middle class single woman who barely has two nickels to rub together, thanks to her decision to decline Getty family funds in exchange for keeping custody of her kids after divorcing the old man’s drug addicted son. “All the Money in the World” would be ten minutes long if grandpa would just pay what the criminals are asking for the release of his grandson—$17 million—instead of hemming and hawing and trying to get the price down.\xa0', 'Grandpa has reasons for haggling—not good ones, but reasons. Ultimately, though, he just seems like he’s not wired right. His grandson’s opening narration suggests that rich people aren’t actually like you and me—that money has deformed their minds—but the elder Getty’s behavior is so repugnant on so many levels, and so profoundly dislocated from anything resembling empathy, that money alone doesn’t strike me as the best explanation for his actions. I don’t know if this is an unresolved complication, a basic failing of the screenplay, or a dimension that Scott and/or Plummer added to the role during shooting.\xa0', 'If the latter, however, what’s onscreen is more interesting than the younger Getty’s diagnosis, because it means we’re watching an emotionally stunted and perhaps mentally ill person with access to billions allow a blood relative to suffer just so that he can save a few bucks. In other words, it’s not the money, it’s him. To most of us, the stated ransom is an unimaginably huge amount, but to somebody like Getty, it’s the equivalent of the coins hidden under sofa cushions. We’d do whatever it took to save a loved one in similar circumstances, but John Paul the First has such an oversized dealmaker’s ego that he won’t take out his checkbook unless the terms are just right.', 'Gail’s tactical restraint when confronted with her former father-in-law’s iciness is commendable, and Williams plays it just right, letting us see Gail’s anger and frustration while making us believe that she could tamp it down out of sight when dealing with the elder Getty and his associates. What astonishing discipline this woman had! The old cheapskate acts as if this is all just a large-scale version of saving eight bucks buying a statue at a flea market. John Paul III could be murdered or tortured as a result of the stubbornness of an old man who prides himself on never meeting the first offer, and trying to save money on everything, even a transaction as basic as sending out laundry while staying in a five-star hotel (he washes and dries his own sheets to shave a few bucks off his tab).\xa0', 'Scott is relatively restrained here, letting his stars carry the day and declining to unleash the full force of his directorial power except in a handful of intricate setpieces (I won’t specify which ones here, because I doubt anyone but students of the Getty family history know all the details, and a couple of them are genuinely surprising). A certain monotony sets in during the middle section, which replays too many similar beats too close together—if the script were looking to combine or cut incidents, this would’ve been the place to do it—but on the whole this is a more-than-solid effort.\xa0', ""It’s also a throwback of sorts.\xa0Adapted by screenwriter David Scarpa from\xa0John Pearson's 1995 book\xa0Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty, it has a welcome 1970s flavor, by which I mean that it’s about recognizable human beings dealing with tense situations that feel real because they happened. The story is told in classically shaped scenes with beginnings, middles and ends, and shot mostly in real locations. The wide-format cinematography creates tension by shoving characters off to one side or boxing them inside doorways or windows and letting you wonder what unseen threats might be lurking in the rest of the frame.\xa0"", ""As is often the case in his non-science fiction movies, Scott splits the difference between overwhelming, almost tactile-seeming realness, and pure, uncut Hollywood fantasy, and you just have to roll with it. There’s a standard disclaimer at the end of the film, stating that certain liberties were taken with the historical record. I’d imagine that a lot of them had to do with placing Gail and her partner in misery,\xa0Getty's business manager and former CIA operative Fletcher Chase (Mark Wahlberg, who isn’t terrible but does not radiate intelligence and ultimately makes no particular impression). The movie often puts the duo at the sites of dangerous activities that they probably didn’t get anywhere near in real life.\xa0\xa0 "", 'The film is a testament to the awesome work ethic of its 80-year old but still apparently tireless director, who fired Kevin Spacey, the actor who had originally played Getty, a month before the scheduled release date, after Spacey was accused of multiple accounts of sexual misconduct, deleted all of his footage, reshot the affected scenes with Plummer in the role and dropped them into the finished movie. This is not the best place to get into the particulars of the production—they’ll be nothing more than a footnote or asterisk in a couple of decades anyway—but they’re worth noting because the end product is much better than anyone could have expected, considering the challenges faced and met by all involved.\xa0', 'In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if Plummer got another Oscar for this part. If he does, it shouldn’t be seen merely as an acknowledgment of good work under weird and unfortunate circumstances, but as recognition of how precise and fearless he is. There is nothing likable about the elder Getty, indeed very little that’s recognizable as anything but evidence of  profound, maddening dysfunction. Plummer embodies the character so completely that his Getty transcends the movie he’s in, and starts to seem emblematic of the times in which the film was released, an era when money seems to matter more than mercy.\xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

crime "['Crime does pay in the movies, at least for a while — the outlaws in “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” have delightful rides until the authorities intervene.', '“Breaking Bad,” a new seven-part series on AMC about a middle-aged chemistry teacher in Albuquerque who becomes a methamphetamine dealer, wants no part of that Hollywood formula. Walt White’s decision to turn to crime — part midlife crisis, part D.I.Y. estate planning — almost instantly lands him neck-deep in a morass of trouble without his ever experiencing the slightest shiver of a thrill.', 'The series has a slight vein of black humor, but it is very, very dark: “Thelma & Louise” as seen by Dostoyevsky.', 'The gloom is understandable, of course. The economy and the political landscape today are weighed down with the steady lowering of middle-class expectations. The young know better than to assume that they will be better off than their parents; the old cling to the railing, fearful of falling beyond the reach of pensions and Social Security payments.', 'And crime is a particularly tempting fantasy. Be it the new movie “Mad Money,” in which Diane Keaton plays a bourgeois housewife forced to work as a janitor when her husband is laid off, or “Breaking Bad,” films and television increasingly tap into that sense of economic and social backsliding, finding humor and pathos in the white-collar world’s undignified struggle for dignity.', 'It’s the pacing that makes “Breaking Bad” more of a hard slog than a cautionary joy ride. It has good acting, particularly by Bryan Cranston  (“Malcolm in the Middle”), who blends Walt’s sad-sack passivity with glints of wry self-awareness. But the misadventures of Walt and his slacker sidekick, Jesse (Aaron Paul), are a picaresque comedy filmed at the speed of a tragic opera — jokes, visual and verbal, are slowed down from 78 r.p.m. to   33  1/3 by an underlying earnestness, as if it were a foreign art film set in the American Southwest.', 'This is the first series offered by AMC since its heady offering last summer, the hit “Mad Men.” And the network’s next may well be much better. Television follows the same pattern as fiction and families: The second novel and the middle child almost never live up to the expectations stoked by the first.', '“Breaking Bad,” created by Vince Gilligan, a writer and executive producer of “The X-Files,” couldn’t be more different from “Mad Men,” but it also lacks that series’s originality and sparkle. This crime story is in many ways a bleaker male version of “Weeds,” Showtime’s comedy about a widowed soccer mom who sells pot to keep up with the Joneses.', 'Walt’s slide into the crime lane is perhaps easier to understand. He has just turned 50; his wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), is pregnant;  their teenage son has cerebral palsy; and his teaching salary is so small that he works a second job in a car wash. Fate doesn’t leave it at that: after collapsing at the car wash, Walt discovers that he has a fatal disease. “Are you a smoker?” the paramedic examining him in the ambulance asks.', 'That Walt once held promise and high expectations is signaled early on. In the first episode he is already awake when his alarm clock rings at 5 a.m., and he dutifully rises and begins trudging on an indoor stepper, one of those cheap exercise gizmos sold on late-night cable, and stares into space. The camera travels to the wall in front of him and lingers on a framed certificate, an acknowledgment of his contribution to a Nobel Prize in chemistry. (Skyler, who writes short stories, has her own set of disappointments.)', 'Walt doesn’t tell his wife or friends about his condition, possibly because he rarely gets a word in edgewise. His wife is kindly but briskly overbearing, checking to see if he took his echinacea and scolding him for buying fax paper at Staples with the wrong credit card.', 'And Walt’s in-laws are the kind who would drive even a stronger man crazy. Skyler’s sister, Marie, played deliciously by Betsy Brandt, is a narcissist and busybody, categories  that should cancel each other out but rarely do, and Marie’s husband, Hank (Dean Norris), is a swaggering D.E.A. agent who has vast reserves of self-regard and who inadvertently gives Walt his criminal start.', '“The Wire,” on HBO, is the rare series that takes its criminals from the criminal class — drug dealers are second- and third-generation felons with no connection to the outside world. Most shows prefer comic contrasts, the “Trading Places” conceit: a P.T.A. mom turns pot dealer on “Weeds”; a New Jersey mobster is a suburban dad on “The Sopranos.”', 'The Whites are a middle-class couple trapped in a lower-middle-class struggle — with creditors, health-insurance brokers, employers and the lifeless bedroom community they call home. They are upstanding citizens with outstanding debts, and when life deals them an insurmountable blow, Walt strikes back by joining the underworld.', ""A version of this review appears in print on , on Page E29 of the New York edition with the headline: When Going Gets Tough, a Not-So-Tough Turns to Meth.

crime "['Andy Samberg rose to fame on the tidal waves of his oft viral “SNL Digital Shorts”. Many of these were huge hits (Dick in a Box, I’m on a Boat, Lazy Sunday), and some were forgettable. In 2013, after SNL, Samberg became the featured player in FOX’s cop comedy Brooklyn 99. For an actor whose success had previously relied on short, quotable clips and songs gaining online popularity, Samberg’s current project has demonstrated a surprising quality: consistency.', 'Brooklyn 99 brings together creators Daniel Goor and Michael Schur, who combined, have been involved in many of the great TV comedies of the last decade. Goor is a longtime comedy writer, with lengthy stints on The Daily Show and Late Night with Conan O’Brien. \xa0Schur was a writer for both SNL and Parks and Rec. He also played Dwight Shrute’s enigmatic cousin Mose on The Office and did some writing there as well. With the backdrop of the NYPD’s 99th Precinct Goor and Schur have created a diverse and quirky cast that delivers plenty of laughs even with very little story. As a credit to the excellent writing, week to week Brooklyn 99 has been one of the most consistent comedies on TV, there never seems to be a dud episode.', 'In a cop drama the cases are the plot. You are supposed to care about who did it and whether justice is served, and the characters operate within that framework. In Brooklyn 99, a cop comedy, the cases are just something that is going on throughout the episode with very little reason for the viewer to care about if they catch the drug dealer or not. Minimizing the crime fighting aspect of the show allows the characters to interact more in the precinct, which is a much better way to deliver comedy than trying to make homicide funny week in and week out. But for viewers conditioned to 1-hour cop dramas (even lighthearted ones like Castle), the first few episodes of Brooklyn 99 that you watch may feel uncomfortable. “There’s no way the guy they just arrested did it! It’s too simple! There must be a plot twist coming!”. Nope, there isn’t (usually). It’s a 30-minute comedy. Adjust your zeal for seeing cop procedure accordingly.', 'Samberg’s character, Detective Jake Peralta, is not exactly an acting stretch for the SNL alum. Peralta is unabashedly juvenile, constantly sarcastic, and never takes anything seriously. It’s pretty much Samberg’s wheelhouse. He’s super comfortable in the role and it works well to have a character with such a serious occupation and the demeanor of a middle schooler. It would have been all too easy to have made the character of Jake Peralta out of the cool-cop-who’s-unfazed-by-everything mold. But Peralta is an endearing and almost vulnerable character who strives for the affections of his coworkers and boss, all the while comparing events happening around him to Die Hard, the reason he became a cop. It all works.', 'Peralta is joined in “The 99” by his partner and dedicated foodie Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio). The Boyle character can be cloying at times, but delivers enough weirdness (particularly related to his dad dating another cop’s mom) to make it worthwhile to have him around. Peralta’s childhood friend Gina Linetti (played by Chelsea Peretti) serves as the civilian administrative assistant for the precinct. Peretti brings a bizarre confidence to the glittery sweater-wearing, dance enthusiast, and self-declared cultural icon that is Gina. Terry Crews plays Sargent Terry Jeffords. Crews (of Old Spice commercial fame) isn’t exactly a comedy dynamo. But he’s serviceable, and his presence sets up lots of great drooling from Gina.', 'Other precinct inhabitants include the duo of Hitchcock and Scully (Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller). Michael Schur may have borrowed a move from his time at Parks and Rec by introducing not one, but two Jerry Gergich-esque characters into Brooklyn 99. Like Jerry, Hitchcock and Scully exist to be the brunt of everyone elses’ jokes and scorn. And they take it all without getting their feelings hurt so that you can feel comfortable laughing at them too! It’s a neat little comedy trick. Detectives Rosa Diaz and Amy Santiago (Stephanie Beatriz and Melissa Fumero) round out the crew (Brookyln 99 gets props for having a cast that’s made up of two-thirds Hispanic women, you don’t see that often). One weak point in the show is the romantic connection between Santiago and Peralta. While cute, it lacks any semblance of real spark. Jim and Pam they are not.', '“The 99” is supervised by Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher of The Wire). Holt is stone-faced, consummately professional, anti-fun, high-brow, gay, meticulous, and hilarious. Braugher’s dead pan delivery is impeccable and scene stealing. The reluctant (on Holt’s part) budding mentorship between Holt and Peralta is one of the better recurring themes of the show.', 'Now three seasons in, Brooklyn 99 is at a point where it might start to show its age soon. Through its junior year, the lighthearted cop comedy has been one of the most consistent, though not always adventuresome, sources of laughs on TV (certainly on network TV). Will they be able to maintain that consistency beyond their\xa0third year and move into the league of long-running great network comedies like 30 Rock, Parks and Rec, or Frasier? Or will the cop show setting finally start to feel more like a limitation than an inspiration for comedy? With the excellent cast and well developed characters we suspect it will be the former. This is a show with enough talent that we’d watch them just hand out parking tickets for a couple more seasons.']" "[' Comedy', ' Crime']" "Brooklyn Nine-Nine"
crime "['“Gotham” begins with classic Batman visuals: a hooded figure crouches between a pair of gargoyles before jumping off a building. Except that it’s not Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. the Batman, who’s going off the roof. He’s still 8 years old and has yet to beat up his first criminal. At that moment he’s leaving a movie theater with his parents.', 'Judged among this fall’s group of new television shows, the pilot for Fox’s “Gotham” (beginning Monday night) stands out for what it has: a distinctive look, a dash of style, a collection of slightly exaggerated but convincing performances. People who come to it because of its Batman connection, though, are likely to focus on what it doesn’t have, which is a costumed hero.', 'If they stick around, they can see whether the series continues to pull off the trick of being credible as both a more or less straight-ahead crime drama (its essential structure) and a glossy comic-book adaptation (its marketing mandate). The show’s creator, Bruno Heller, has experience with the nonprocedural procedural — he made “The Mentalist” for CBS, which has survived into a seventh season by placing less emphasis on detective work than on workplace humor and the winsome charm of its star, Simon Baker. “Gotham” presents a similar sort of challenge, but its dark, dystopian, highly stylized mode will give it a higher degree of difficulty.', 'One of the fall’s three new comics-inspired series (along with NBC’s “Constantine” and CW’s “Flash”), “Gotham” is being called a Batman prequel. That’s true and not true, as it begins with the same foundational scene that every new Batman narrative — including Tim Burton’s “Batman” and Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins” — must include, though usually in flashback.', 'On their way home from the theater (the opera in the more grandiose “Batman Begins”), Bruce’s parents are gunned down in the street as he watches. In “Gotham,” the murders are also witnessed by a rooftop prowler, who will turn out to be Selina Kyle, the future Catwoman.', 'But instead of jumping forward a couple of decades to the grown-up Bruce in cape and mask, the show stays in the present and introduces its actual hero, James Gordon, the younger version of the familiar Commissioner Gordon. Here he’s a brash young detective who catches the Wayne case, befriends Bruce and his stoic butler, Alfred, and gets a quick education in Gotham City’s moral rot.', 'Much of the fun of “Gotham,” at least initially, lies in seeing which Batman characters Mr. Heller and his staff have chosen to incorporate and how they’ve tweaked them. In addition to Gordon, there’s the brutal cop Harvey Bullock, here cast as Gordon’s partner, and a roster of proto-villains or adversaries: Kyle, a very young Ivy Pepper (presumably the future Poison Ivy), a police forensics technician named Edward Nygma (the future Riddler) and the apprentice gangster Oswald Cobblepot, who hates his nickname, Penguin.', 'As Gordon, Ben McKenzie is solid in a more theatrical version of the upright-cop role he played in “Southland.” Donal Logue is reliably blustery and sarcastic as Bullock. The biggest impressions are made by the villains, whose smaller roles are looser and more fun: Robin Lord Taylor as Cobblepot, Cory Michael Smith as Nygma and Jada Pinkett Smith as a new character, a chartreuse-haired gang boss with the distracting name Fish Mooney.', 'The real star of the “Gotham” pilot is its consistent style, a combination of production design, cinematography and writing that manages to evoke both the bang-pow 1940s spirit of the original “Batman” and post-”Blade Runner” neo-noir. If you’re going to make yet another show or movie about an honest cop in a corrupt city, you’d better make it look good, and this Gotham City, with its nightmarish gothic skyline under perpetually gray skies, looks pretty good.', 'Produced by Warner Brothers Television. Based on characters from DC Comics; Bruno Heller, Danny Cannon and John Stephens, executive producers.', 'WITH: Ben McKenzie (Det. James Gordon), Donal Logue (Det.

He's true to his pals and willing to give good people the benefit of the doubt. But criminals and terrorists should beware of making him mad, because McGarrett will shoot with little provocation. He's a character who works best in a world where everything is black or white, good or bad. The show's cast is diverse overall, and much has been made of the fact that co-star Grace Park was cast in a role that went to a man in the original series."", 'Well-trained commandos frequently take on equally well-trained terrorists and criminal gangs using automatic weapons, attack helicopters, and some intense martial arts moves. Lots of gun battles, and people are shot and some die (albeit generally quickly and fairly bloodlessly).

There are dead bodies shown, bloody and mauled.', ""Plenty of women in bikinis. An undercover officer must take off her dress, ostensibly to prove she isn't carrying a wire, but the bad guys take the opportunity to leer at her in her underwear.

There's a lot of shooting first and asking questions later -- though not everyone survives the shooting part. Expect lots of gunfights, often using automatic weapons, and some deaths. As the series has progressed, it's grown more violent, and more likely to focus on murder than other crimes. Viewers will see car accidents, scantily clad women in jeopardy, serial killers, dead bodies, violence that causes blood to splatter everywhere, and so on. There are also autopsies with bloody, gory dead bodies on a table, and graphic photos of their injuries displayed above. Beach scenes are often an excuse for the camera to leer at women in bikinis. Other than the name, the location, and -- of course -- the theme music, there's little connection between this series (which, like most contemporary crime shows, also includes some drinking, language, and skimpy outfits) and the original."", 'Steve McGarrett (Alex O’Loughlin), a former Navy SEAL, returns home to Hawaii to bring down the terrorist who killed his father in HAWAII FIVE-0. When he arrives, the governor (Jean Smart) offered him a job: heading up an elite new crime-fighting unit designed to bring down the worst offenders in the islands. ""Your rules,"" she promised him, ""my backing, no red tape."" In other words, McGarrett had free rein to hunt down the bad guys with no regard for standard cop procedure. He could shoot first and ask questions later. But McGarrett\'s carte blanche was cut short when the governor was murdered, and the new governor had much less patience with his freewheeling ways. Now McGarrett acts more like a traditional cop, chasing down clues in each week\'s case with the help of his team: Danny ""Danno"" Williams (Scott Caan), a New Jersey expatriate who\'s no fan of the beach; Chin Ho Kelly (Daniel Dae Kim), who was caught up in a corruption scandal and forced out of the Honolulu Police Department; and Kono Kalakaua (Grace Park), Chin Ho\'s cousin, the least experienced team member who\'s eager to make a name for herself. Other recurring characters include Dr. Max Bergman (Masi Oka), the chief medical examiner who performs autopsies under the direction of the Five-0 team, Lieutenant Catherine Rollins (Michelle Borth), Steve McGarrett\'s sometimes-girlfriend and Navy intelligence officer, and Kamekona (Taylor Wily), a shave ice truck owner and informant who\'s chummy with McGarrett.', ""Don't look for realism here, as this show is all about the action, and there's plenty of it.

For starters: Jackie Chan, an action star who is struggling to find age-appropriate roles in his sixties, is barely in ""The Foreigner,"" an adaptation of Stephen Leather\'s source novel.\xa0This is especially disappointing since\xa0Chan\'s Sparkle Roll Media production\xa0company is prominently foregrounded in the film\'s opening credits, and he\'s featured prominently in the film\'s marketing. Then again, maybe Chan\'s absence is\xa0for the best given how\xa0unconvincing his performance is as grieving 61-year-old ex-military man\xa0Quan.\xa0', 'Quan is defined by his age, and his monomaniacal need to get eye-for-an-eye justice since his daughter was blown up in a bank explosion by an organization calling themselves ""the\xa0Authentic IRA.""

Chan also tends to vanish\xa0for long stretches at a time\xa0while a bunch of British and Irish diplomats, policemen,\xa0and terrorists talk, debrief, and generally drown viewers in a convoluted story\xa0of political intrigue. Imagine all the worst parts of a Robert Ludlum novel—overlong expository dialogue, monotonous and all-too-brief action scenes, and a hero who can never be found when you need him—and replace Jason Bourne with Jackie Chan playing an unflattering Charles Bronson-type character and you have ""The Foreigner.""', 'Much of ""The Foreigner"" revolves around the back-channel dealings of Irish diplomat Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), a former-IRA member who is now hellbent on protecting his decades-long\xa0legacy of\xa0diplomacy with the British.

Hennessy, an antihero defined by Brosnan\'s atrocious Irish accent and a\xa0forehead peppered with\xa0liver spots that seem to proliferate with every extreme closeup, spends a lot of time\xa0on the phone, and drinking Scotch.

And there\'s\xa0a lot of exhausting and exhaustive backstory, none of which plays to Chan\'s talents as a performer, or director Martin Campbell\'s strengths\xa0as an action filmmaker. Campbell is\xa0best known as the helmer of the franchise-reviving James Bond films ""Casino Royale"" and ""GoldenEye."" But he was probably\xa0hired to direct ""The Foreigner""\xa0because of his knack for cheesy revenge dramas, particularly the surprisingly okay 2010 ""Edge of Darkness"" remake. Sadly, none of that earlier\xa0film\'s knack for preposterous, testosterone-driven violence is here in ""The Foreigner,"" possibly because\xa0""Edge of Darkness"" screenwriter and\xa0meathead cinema poet\xa0laureate\xa0William Monahan didn\'t adapt ""The Foreigner"" too.\xa0', 'As a result, watching ""The Foreigner"" is a thoroughly dispiriting experience. You\xa0wait for characters to take a break from gabbing\xa0about Hennessy\'s connections\xa0with everyone from old IRA members to, uh, newer IRA members.

He clearly has some moves, but his\xa0character is supposed to be old and slow. So Chan must get pummeled twice for every blow he lands. Sadly,\xa0the blows that Chan does dish out\xa0are graceless and mechanical. The choreography of these scenes is intentionally\xa0ragged, even if Campbell films them well enough.

Ignoring the narrow beauty standards some African-American women are held to, Ms. Rhimes chose a performer who is older, darker-skinned and less classically beautiful than Ms. Washington, or for that matter Halle Berry, who played an astronaut on the summer mini-series “Extant.”', 'Ms. Davis is perhaps best known for her role in “The Help” as a stoic maid in the segregated South, a role for which she was nominated for a best actress Oscar.

It\'s often hard to understand Barry\'s motives\xa0beyond caricature-broad assumptions about his (lack of) character.

Schafer doesn\'t do real work—not in the filmmakers\' eyes.\xa0The same is true of Escobar and his fellow dealers, who are treated as lawless salesmen of an unsavory product.\xa0And don\'t get me started on JB (Caleb Landry Jones), Lucy\'s lazy, Gremlin-driving, under-age-girl-dating, Confederate-flag-waving redneck brother.', ""But what about Lucy?

The argument, and the scene end just like that, like a smug joke whose punchline might as well be,\xa0There's no problem that\xa0a ton of cash can't solve."", '""American Made"" sells a toxic, shallow, anti-American Dream bill of goods for anybody looking to shake their head about\xa0exceptionalism without seriously considering what conditions enable that mentality.\xa0Spinelli and Liman don\'t say anything except,\xa0Look at how far a determined charmer can go if he\'s greedy and determined enough.

Based on the work of, and produced by, Joel and Ethan Coen, the 10-episode series is only connected to the original film in the loosest possible sense. It takes place in Minnesota, police investigate foul deeds, and some really weird shit happens.', 'There isn’t really a central character to the thing, though Martin Freeman‘s Lester Nygaard and Billy Bob Thornton‘s Lorne Malvo come closest to filling the role. Instead, there’s something more like a central series of events, and the people who become tangled up in them.', 'Lester is a mild-mannered insurance salesman in the small town of Bemidji, MN. He’s meek in a way that makes meek avert its eyes, and his main problem in life is that his wife and brother can’t stop reminding him of the fact. At least, until one fine day Lester finds himself face-to-face with the bully from High School who figures there’s no point in not having a go at Lester again, even if it is twenty-something years later. This lands Lester in the hospital with a broken nose.', 'Meanwhile, Lorne Malvo is passing through on his way to Duluth when he hits a deer on the highway. The crash creates an opening for the guy in Malvo’s trunk to get away and hoof it into the woods, but being in his underwear, and this being northern Minnesota in winter, the escape doesn’t go well. Malvo’s bump on the head from the crash leads him to the hospital, where he happens to sit next to Lester in the waiting room.', 'Much like the case of the film, what follows is a string of murders, and a variety of other, often bizarre, crimes, and we follow along with perpetrators, the police, and those caught up in the tide.', 'The film worked so well, mainly, because as weird and wonderful as the plot was, it was almost irrelevant. Like most Coen brothers films, it was a strict, and deeply intricate character study. The show works because that remains the same.', 'It isn’t so much about the murders, as it is a kind of display of what people do when crazy shows up on their door. How do they really react? What makes them do what they do? And, how does it come to pass that they inexplicably find themselves on the other end of said crazy?', 'For all that Malvo will ultimately be painted as the devil, and a multitude of references once in a few episodes make the idea hard to avoid, he’s really working more of a Loki angle. He may be a hit man, or whatever he is exactly, but really he just likes messing with people. Winding them up, whispering in their ear, nudging them ever so slightly, and just watching it all play out. How that touch of chaos works people over is really what the show is about, and it’s sold brilliantly.', 'The fun and focus may bob and weave around Lester, but the side touches add the spice needed to bring the whole thing together. For example, Colin Hanks‘ Duluth officer who finds himself dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight, and the furious self-examination that follows. Coupled with the spot on performance by Allison Tolman as Molly (awesomely) Solverson, the officer in Bemidji, who won’t stop worrying the threads until something, by God, makes some sense, they provide the touchstone for the audience’s reactions and questions.', 'The show also capitalizes on that strange touch of moody desolation that reminds of the film’s purpose in offering up the frozen plains as a backdrop, even to the extent that most of the residents (who don’t flat out complain aloud) manage to look around at one point or another with an expression that seems to wonder, “Why the hell do I live here?” It’s the use and necessity of these small touches – like the hints at a kind of societal, resigned ennui – that offer up a spark of intellectual sport that has been missing from most of television for far too long. Here is a story that cannot be told without it being winter, or including a side character to experience our moral dilemma for us, or his daughter to serve as his confidant, and moreover it is written by people who are aware of all this.', 'All that said, Fargo is a show that must be endured through its first fifteen minutes, and that is no small chore. Lester’s establishment, by way of his emasculating wife, and the borderline nonsensical bully, is amateurishly handled, and it needn’t have been. The scenes are so contrived and overdone that they not only lose their power, they border on the unwatchable, and considering where things move, a certain subtlety of delivery here would have made for a stronger punch when things actually get moving. I blame the slip here on the necessity of expedience, given the limited total run of the show.', 'Once past this point, and no one should be allowed to give up before the end of the first episode for any reason, virtually everything is perfect. It is not only the most fun you’re going to have watching television all year, it’s also going to hit most viewers that they can hardly remember the pangs of anticipation this series causes.', '\n\n\xa0×\xa0\nfive\n\xa0=\xa0\nthirty five\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.hide-if-no-js {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n', 'Please enter your username or email address.

A witty, thrilling US women’s prison drama based on Piper Kerman’s memoir Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison, OITNB not only passed the Bechdel test but wore its intersectional feminist heart tattooed brightly on sleeve, creator and executive producer Jenji Kohan helming a crew and cast more intentionally diverse than anything preceding it.', 'A number of critics complained that framing a series featuring so many women of colour through the lens of thin, white, middle-class protagonist Piper Chapman (played with commendably doe-eyed comedic timing by Taylor Schilling) undermined its gains. Writer Aura Bogado went so far as to call this a modern-day slave narrative for the internet age. But three series in, it’s clear that Piper – doing time in low-security clink Litchfield for a decade-old drug-trafficking offence exposed by ex-girlfriend and fellow inmate Alex Vause\xa0(Laura Prepon) – is the Trojan Horse Kohan promised us from the get-go:', '“You’re not going to go into a network and sell a show on really fascinating tales of black women, and Latina women, and old women and criminals. But if you take this white girl, this sort of fish out of water, and you follow her in, you can then expand your world and tell all of those other stories. But it’s a hard sell to just go in and try to sell those stories initially. The girl next door, the cool blonde, is a very easy access point, and it’s relatable for a lot of audiences and a lot of networks looking for a certain demographic. It’s useful.”', 'Piper is more than a Trojan Horse, though – she’s a totem of white privilege, and Kohan invites us to relish the flogging she receives at Litchfield’s violent, dilapidated, bug-infested bedlam. Spa dates are replaced with grim communal showers, normcore clothes with prison-issue jumpsuit and the fledgling artisanal bath-product business she had pre-prison with the contraband and commissary pap that make up Litchfield’s internal currency.', 'Kohan’s adept at this study of self-absorbed bougie woman in criminal freefall after steering long-running Showtime series Weeds, which chronicled the exploits of housewife-turned-pot-kingpin Nancy Botwin. The same wry, shank-sharp wit is at work here, lacing the frequently dark prison plotlines – rape, menopause, addiction, gang violence – with expertly weighted humour; if we root for Chapman’s lost rich girl, it’s because, like model Rachel Robert’s trophy blonde in Rihanna’s Bitch Better Have My Money video, she’s the epitome of self-absorbed affluence; watching her cut down to size by the women her privilege had sheltered her from is deliciously gratifying.', 'Unlike Roberts, Piper offers a more complex antihero. As her clueless, country-club deb scrambles to navigate Litchfield’s fraught, high-stake rules (official and unofficial) and find her place among the mostly race-aligned cliques, we marvel at her naivety, her hardwired sense of entitlement as the system slowly breaks her down.', 'Kohan works plenty of comedy mileage out of Piper’s haplessness throughout season one, but it’s also in the trouble that fecklessness produces that the promise of growth – a kind of reverse rehabilitation – manifests itself. It’s only when she accidentally insults Galina ‘Red’ Reznikov, the magnificently august Russian-American matriarch played by Kate Mulgrew (late of Star Trek’s USS Voyager), that Piper truly realises her predicament; all that polite, intellectual New England charm – so effective on the outside – is redundant here among the criminals and psychopaths. Forced to employ a combination of humility, moxie and sacrifice, she ends up procuring then chewing a pile of hot chilies to produce a DIY-style Deep Heat balm for Red’s arthritic back – a reprieve-worthy gambit.', 'As Litchfield sands off her soft edges, Piper’s character evolves. When a troupe of delinquent teens are brought in for a tour of Litchfield towards the end of season one, it is her – not the stereotype-aping convicts – that put the fear of prison into them. By the close of season two Piper has dumped Larry (Jason Biggs), the hapless fiancé she left on the outside, for a volatile reunion with Alex, earned the safe indifference of her peers and – as a benchmark measure of her transformation – even finds herself losing patience with the younger version of her old self in new inmate Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn).', 'Come season three, Piper’s a fully fledged jailbird, graduating from witless blonde to savvy crime boss, overseeing a cottage industry selling used prison panties to fetishists (another to-good-to-be-true plot-line based on real life events). Is this proof she’s learnt to fend for herself, sans trust fund? Or has prison merely fomented some innate, white-capitalist instinct? When the inmates she employs to grease those panties find out she’s paying them a pittance and form a union to demand a better wage, it seems the answer is: both.', 'The sprawling cast of characters Piper orbits are just as, if not more, compelling than the series’ figurehead we all love to hate. Heartbreaking, inspiring and hilarious by turns, their origin stories – like Piper’s – are told gradually, piecemeal, through compelling flashbacks. Making sense of the inmates individually – who they are, how they came to be at Litchfield, how they navigate their sentence and each other – is the crux of OITNB’s charm.', 'Among the shifting cast of supporting and major players is the aforementioned Red; Suzanne ‘Crazy Eyes’ Warren, Uzo Aduba’s violent yet loveably vulnerable psych ward veteran; trans bombshell Sophia Burset, played with grace and depth by activist and Time magazine cover star Laverne Cox; Dayanara ‘Daya’ Diaz, a daughter of the Hispanic clique who ends up pregnant following an illicit relationship with one of the prison guards; Natasha Lyonne’s wise-cracking ex-junkie Nicole ‘Nicky’ Nichols; comedian Lea Delaria’s fat, swaggering butch Big Boo and Tasha ‘Taystee’ Jefferson, the effervescently entertaining librarian played by Danielle Brooks.', 'The sweet, chatty simpatico Taystee and bestie Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) enjoy is a delight: incisive, gesticulating real-talk delivered with carefree wit, and frequently used to troll Piper’s gormless bystander (Taystee to Pouseey, in fake middle-class accent: “Amanda, did you hear that new piece on NPR about hedge funds?”).', 'This affectionate and tender bond is jeopardised in season two, when Taystee’s Machiavellian foster mother Yvone ‘Vee’ Parker (Lorraine Toussain) arrives at Litchfield and wastes no time commandeering the circle, turning the crew into drug dealers and instigating a violent bathroom turf war with the Hispanics in the process. Vee’s grooming and exploitation of Crazy Eyes – and the upsetting scenes this produces – is supremely acted and deeply uncomfortable viewing.', 'These constantly shifting inmate dynamics – romances, feuds, friendships, allegiances – are compelling stuff, but the power struggles between the prisoners and the mostly male prison staff provide some meaty plot-lines. Kohan ensures the guards, as much as Piper, are complex, layered characters rather than slotting them into any rote villain/protector binary – men struggling with their respective definitions of masculinity in a women-centric space. We see a surprisingly vulnerable side to Pablo Schreiber’s gloriously sleazy macho man George ‘Pornstache’ Mendez (graduate of the Jim Fenner school of screws) in season two, while Councillor Healy (Michael Harney) vacillates precariously between harmless, grey-haired grandpa and vicious, immature homophobe throughout – with sometimes dire consequences for Litchfield’s most vulnerable inmates.', 'OITNB is a show about women, and how we survive a society so thoroughly rigged in patriarchy’s favour. It’s about the joy and pain of female relationships, and the ingenious, wonderful and desperate things women do to survive life behind bars.', 'Kohan – working closely with Kerman, who left prison and became an active advocate for reform – is careful to root every drama and plot to real, historic and current socio-political issues. Haitian old timer Claudette Pelage (Michelle Hurst)’s story of exploitative child labour speaks to the ongoing crisis that is immigration; trafficking in the west is an issue which Diane Guerrero, who plays Maritza Ramos’s tough Latina hood princess, has articulated first-hand knowledge of off-camera; Sophia’s struggles to access hormones and with transphobic violence address the real and tragic issue of trans folk’s fettered access to essential healthcare and treatment in prison. And in season three – when Litchfield is privatised – we see the multitude of ways the corrupt prison-industrial complex puts profit before human life. Very little here feels superfluous, with the forgivable exception of Ruby Rose’s gratuitous nude scene in season three.', 'Gripping (and frequently hilarious) plots, razor-sharp dialogue, a talented, diverse cast and ubiquitous queerness elevate OITNB above prison dramas of yesteryear. This is TV finessed for an intersectional, privilege-checking era – not just savvy to the (white cis middle-class) male gaze but flipping it the bird. While out lesbian characters are slowly filtering into mainstream programming, they’re still frequently cliché, tokenised or killed off – victims of the dead lesbian trope.', 'Litchfield isn’t without its casualties, but on the whole its various queers are believable and investment-worthy, from Poussey’s adorably cheerful boi and Crazy Eyes’ Shakespeare-quoting weirdo to intellectual pin-up Alex Vause\xa0aka ‘the Betty Page of Litchfield’, as Boo christens her. The tangled, romantic dance that Piper and Alex do is compelling, nuanced and sexy where, in other hands, it might have felt exploitative.', 'With so many diverse LGBTQ women – stretching across age, race, size and creed – OITNB feels for many (this writer included) like the progressive, politicised next-gen answer to Ilene Chaiken’s much-missed, groundbreaking Showtime series The L Word – an enjoyable coincidence given that Chaiken’s first post-L Word project was slated to be a women’s prison-based spin-off called The Farm.', 'It’s far from niche queer viewing, though; OITNB’s reach into pop culture has made each new season an occasion event, warranting a zillion memes, binge-viewing TV parties and prison-themed gatherings, not to mention the ‘no OITNB spoilers please’ requests that proliferate online when social media users have to wait till work is over to devour a new series.

Perhaps by that time sufficient evidence will have been gathered to explain just why a movie assembled by a group of mostly first-rate talents wound up such a soggy, slushy mess. I myself cannot quite figure it out.', 'Adapted from the bestselling mystery novel by Jø Nesbo, the movie stars Michael Fassbender as a Norwegian police detective with the much-already-remarked-upon name Harry Hole. Why they couldn’t have just called him Harry Chasm or Harry Abyss is beyond me. The movie begins with what turns out to be a flashback. The scene is shot with what appears to be a lilac petal dangling in front of the lens. In a large cabin in a snow-covered field, a man in a police car visits a young boy and his mother. And there the man administers a test to the boy, slapping the mother every time the kid gets a question wrong. Things go from bad to worse, and eventually a Volvo sinks into a lake, and a kid is left homeless. Cut to the present day, and Harry is sleeping off a drunk in a bus shelter. Heckuva way for a cop to conduct himself, but Harry’s a special cop. A little later on in the picture, Katrine Bratt, who becomes Harry’s unofficial partner on a serial killer case, tells him that she studied his cases in “the academy.” Harry’s a genius detective whose personal life is an utter mess. One of the movie’s many problems is that the viewer is treated to much more of the mess part than the genius part. In point of fact, I don’t think the genius part ever emerges.   ', 'I mentioned first-rate talents. The cast is what they used to call one of “International All-Stars.” Aside from Fassbender, there’s the engaging Rebecca Ferguson as Bratt. Charlotte Gainsbourg is here as Harry’s ex-girlfriend. Toby Jones is a policeman in another Norway town. Val Kilmer, his voice rather badly and inexplicably dubbed, turns up. As does J.K. Simmons, speaking in his own voice and applying to it a credible and yet somehow incredible mid-Atlantic accent. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard him say “gah-raaaahzzh,” but I’m not sure I’d pay sixteen bucks for the privilege.   ', 'There are big names who should know better behind the camera as well. The director is Tomas Alfredson, who made the very excellent 2008 “Let the Right One In” and the very ambitious and mostly excellent 2011 “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.” The three screenwriters, Peter Straughan, Hossein Amini, and Søren Sveistrup, have not unusually disgraced themselves in the courses of their respective careers. The editor is Thelma Schoonmaker, the veteran of much work with Martin Scorsese, who is here an executive producer. On the subject of editing, let’s move back to that opening scene. Given to where it cuts to, the viewer might infer that the movie’s orphan grows up to be its hero. Which provides a frisson, or is meant to provide a frisson, to the fact that the movie’s serial killer seems to know an awful lot about Harry, and that the killer constructs snowmen at the scenes of his crimes, snowmen that look an awful lot like one that appears in the opening scene. How, one might wonder, did the killer get sufficient insight into Harry and his past to be able to taunt him like this?   ', 'Well, not to give anything away, but the film is constructed to misdirect the viewer as much as possible. I think there’s a relatively simple reason for this, and it also has to do with why this ostensibly adult thriller has an ending that’s almost literally a gloss from a “Scooby-Doo” episode: the actual plot, once laid out in a way that makes sense, is so patently packed with convenient coincidences that it’s practically simple-minded.   ', 'Another problem is this: snowmen aren’t scary, and when you try too hard to make them scary, you just make it worse. The movie is strewn with camera pans from innocent-looking street scenes to … THREATENING SNOWMAN FACE, and the effect is very Dramatic Chipmunk, only less dynamic. To top off all of the ineffective weirdness, the movie ends on a tone-deaf “got a sequel if you want it” note. I do believe, and I’m sorry for this, that it’ll be a cold day in hell before any such thing materializes.\xa0 ', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

Ozark stars\xa0Jason Bateman,\xa0Laura Linney,\xa0Sofia Hublitz,\xa0Skylar Gaertner,\xa0Julia Garner,\xa0Jason Butler Harner and\xa0Esai Morales.', 'At first I was a little unsure if I wanted to check out Ozark on Netflix, because after watching a couple of trailers, I wasn’t sure Jason Bateman would be great in a show that looks to have such a serious and dark tone to it. The actor is well known to be good with comedy roles and while I did see him do well in The Gift, I wasn’t so sure how he’d be in Ozark. But I can tell you that after watching all of the show, that Jason Bateman was actually perfect for the role and was very impressive in each and every episode of Ozark. After this. I am now a fully converted Jason Bateman fan.', 'What was even more impressive about Jason Bateman in Ozark, was that he actually did direct 4 out of the 10 episodes for the first season. These included episode 1\xa0“Sugarwood”,\xa0 episode 2 “Blue Cat”, episode 9 “Coffee Black” and episode 10 “The Toll”. I want to mention this because although he has done some directing work in the past with things like The Family Fang (2015), Ozark was something so much bigger than much of his previous works. The dark tone of the show that was set in the first episode was well maintained throughout the show and defined much of the Ozark experience.', 'Ozark’s dark tone is well suited to its narrative about a dodgy financial adviser who works as a financial manager for a Mexican drug cartel, who have him laundering money for them. Things early on go bad for our main character Martin, who has a falling out with his boss and as a last effort to save himself and his family, he suggests relocating from the city to the Ozarks in Missouri. It’s far away from the prying eyes of investigators where he can do his job well and in peace as it’s sort of quiet place no one knows about. Unknown to Martin though, is that the Ozark region isn’t such a nice and quiet place and the people are much tougher and even more cunning than those in the city. Along the way, the narrative frequently throws in complications created by various characters who live in the Ozark region, which keeps things interesting. Will Martin be able to save his family and complete his job at the new location?', 'The acting in Ozark is excellent. While I thought that Jason Bateman was great and have mentioned him enough, I was most impressed with\xa0Julia Garner who plays Ruth, a resident of Ozark. Ruth is a character that I thought embodies what you would call “street smarts” in a way that she’s able to take advantage of most situations easily, but she’s also almost like a villain in the show. Julia Garner was able to do a lot with this character and played her perfectly. There was a lot of character development for Ruth over the course of the show and she certainly was an interesting one to watch.', 'Another actor I thought was quite good was\xa0Esai Morales who some may know for his work on Caprica (2009). In Ozark, Esai Morales plays Del, who is from the Mexican cartel and is sort of the boss of Martin. Del really is generally the villain of the show and spends much of his time antagonising Martin (Jason Bateman). In the scenes with both Jason Bateman and\xa0Esai Morales the two worked well opposite each other and there was always a sense of tension when the two characters met.', 'Other actors such as\xa0Laura Linney,\xa0Sofia Hublitz,\xa0Skylar Gaertner, Jason Butler Harner\xa0 and everyone else in the show were all good too and no one was really bad or anything.', 'Over the course of the series, you get this very intense story about a family trying to survive in a suburb filled with some pretty bad people who are always looking to take advantage of situations. Martin’s family aren’t really angels themselves and are working for some very bad people who are putting pressure on them to deliver on their word and it makes for an interesting tale. Ozark is a story with heavy themes of survival at all costs and puts into question at times the ethics of certain things, but when you gotta survive, you gotta survive right?', 'Overall Ozark is a very impressive series. I highly recommend taking a look at it on Netflix when you have time or a spare weekend. I spent much of the last few days watching them all on a marathon stream and enjoyed every moment of it. It’s a well written show, with well written characters who all do get quite well developed as things go on. Jason Bateman was impressive, both as an actor and as director and did fine job with his work on Ozark. Julia Garner was also one of the standouts and was phenomenal with her role as Ruth as was Esai Morales. It’s a survival story, with some interesting characters and nice location.

Gary Gray jumps into one of the most successful franchises of all time with “The Fate of the Furious,” the eighth\xa0installment in a series that seems increasingly critic-proof. How big are these movies? They have made almost $4 billion worldwide, with the last one shattering the previous series record, bringing in $1.5 billion on its own. There are big franchises and then there’s “The Fast and the Furious” movies, which have found the perfect blend of international appeal, ridiculous action and, of course, an emphasis on “family,” whatever that word means to you. Regardless of reviews, this series is too big to fail. It’s going to be around for a very long time. But that doesn’t mean we can’t be disappointed that “The Fate of the Furious” distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade.', 'With a series that has been this wide-ranging in terms of critical appeal, it feels like a declaration of taste is appropriate. I didn’t care much about the films at all until “Fast Five” although I agreed that “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift” took more risks and was more fun than the awful second (""2 Fast 2 Furious"") and possibly-worst fourth film (""Fast & Furious""). It took five movies to figure out the franchise, turning them into roller coasters that alternated between cartoonish action set pieces and heartfelt conversations about makeshift families. They seemed like the answer to “What if we made the entire movie like those insane opening bits from the Bond movies? Plus family.” And the series only got better with the inclusion of new faces like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell. Yes, they’re ridiculous—but that’s also why they’re fun. ', ""So, why isn’t “The Fate of the Furious” more fun? That’s going to be the question to which you keep returning as you watch all 136 minutes of this film that’s relatively enjoyable when compared to other hollow blockbusters but relatively disappointing when compared to the high points of this series. First and foremost, it’s a movie that’s over two hours long and has almost no plot. Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) betrays his team after being forced to work against them by a Bond-esque supervillain named Cipher (Charlize Theron). They work to stop him and get him back in their “family.” That’s about it. Throughout, almost everyone gets one-and-a-half emotions. Michelle Rodriguez does the most she can with her blend of confusion and love for the man that may be trying to kill her now. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson do a lot with their characters' rivalry, even it feels more like a Shane Black ‘80s action comedy than this series ever has before. Even the settings seem thin in terms of writing. The action jumps around the globe in a way that looks calculated for international appeal more than any real use of location. I picture a whiteboard in the writers room that says “Cuba=Hot, Russia=Cold.” And while it’s become something of a joke to say that these films are all about “family,” it really functions like a crutch here. They use the word over a dozen times, almost as if it’s the fallback when they couldn’t think of anything else plot-wise to link the action sequences."", 'And here’s where the defenders of the Furious Flame kick in with the chorus that plot doesn’t matter to these films. It’s all about adrenaline, and no one cares that the filmmakers forgot to give at least half the characters anything memorable to do this time around. And there are times when “The Fate of the Furious” bursts into escapist lunacy in which it’s easy to agree. The “big” sequences work, especially a bit with a wave of hacked self-driving cars in New York City and the climactic chaos in Russia that almost feels like it’s mocking the “longest runway in the world” sequence from “Fast & Furious 6” in terms of MPH inconsistency. When “The Fate of the Furious” gives viewers what they’re really paying that ticket price to see, there’s an undeniably goofy, playful, fun time to be had. It’s all the other stuff that starts to really annoy.', 'This failing in the material that connects the action sequences is never more prominent than when Charlize Theron is on screen. ""The Fate of the Furious"" will go down as one of the largest wastes of a major talent in a blockbuster film in years. Likely cast because of how much ass she kicked in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” writer Chris Morgan then neglects to give Theron a single notable action sequence. She’s stuck on a high-tech plane, issuing orders to other people on the ground below. How on Earth do you bring in Imperator Furiosa and not make her race against Dom Toretto? She has one interesting sequence early in the movie, in which she and “Evil Dom” overtake the team, which makes the rest of her arc feel like even more of a disappointment because one sees what she could have done. There’s no heat to this character whatsoever—no physicality, no sexuality, no passion. We don’t even really know why she’s doing what she’s doing, and you can actually see Theron start to get bored. This franchise has always had a villain problem—although it’s increasingly interesting that every villain eventually becomes a hero—but this seems like the biggest misfire, not only in terms of wasted opportunity but how much time Theron is forced to deliver dull, useless exposition.', ""It’s tempting to blame the relative failures of this movie on the loss of the underrated Paul Walker or the new director. The action scenes are well-done, but the rest is surprisingly dull given what Gray has delivered in the past, leading one to believe he was purely for hire. The spectacle works. That’s something we’ve come to expect. I suspect it will continue to work for a few more films. But if they’re going to rise to the entertainment level they’ve hit before, this series needs someone behind the wheel who can make those narrative valleys between the peaks of the roller coaster ride more memorable. Find a writer who can write more interesting dialogue. Find a director who can add visual flair when cars aren’t going boom. Give your increasingly gigantic supporting cast something to do. Of course, none of this will hold “The Fate of the Furious” back from box office glory. At this point, the destination is predetermined—it's the journey to it that's getting exhausting."", 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Baby is a young man who creates remixes of his life. He records conversations had around him (almost always around and not with him) on an old-fashioned mini-cassette recorder, and then mixes them into songs with some wonderfully antiquated keyboard and rhythm equipment. The first one we see him create is called “Was He Slow,” using a question asked by an accomplice about Baby’s mental capacity as a hook. Much like Baby turns the world around him into music, writer/director Edgar Wright remixes the movies and tunes that have influenced him into the wildly joyous and fantastically entertaining “Baby Driver.” As CGI robots clang into each other and superheroes take to the sky, here’s Wright to ask if you remember how movies used to thrill us with a turn of phrase, a squeal of a wheel, a diving plot twist, or a romantic kiss. “Baby Driver” feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It’s as much fun as you’re going to have in a movie theater this year.', 'Yes, his name is “B-A-B-Y, Baby” (Ansel Elgort). At least, that’s the name he gives people when asked, although he’s more often ignored. He’s the nearly silent getaway driver for a robbery syndicate managed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organizes the crime, hires three criminals, and then puts them in Baby’s car. You see, Baby can drive. But he needs music to do it. After a car accident as a kid left him with tinnitus, he spends the vast majority of his waking hours with ear buds in his ears to drown out the ringing. And the world around him moves to the music on one of his many iPods—he has various ones for different moods. Sometimes the world seems to respond to his choice, sometimes his choice seems to influence the world around him—either way, music is as essential to the success of “Baby Driver” as it was to “La La Land,” maybe more.', ""Take the riveting first scene. Three criminals—Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Griff (Jon Bernthal)—leap from a car outside of a bank just as Baby cues up “Bellbottoms” by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in his 'buds. Everything from this point on moves in rhythm with the music from the slamming of the car doors after the bank robbers return to the squealing tires of one of the best car chase scenes in years. We’ve seen countless action scenes scored to pop or rock songs, but how many have you seen in which the action works in unison with the music? And Wright takes this brilliant concept a step further, making even everyday normal activity feel like it’s part of Baby’s soundtrack. The sound of someone typing a text message on a phone or placing stacks of money on a table will work with the beat of a song, creating a film that has a rhythm, flow and structure from first frame to last that works in conjunction with its soundtrack. It’s fluid and jaw-dropping—the kind of thing you want to see immediately again after it’s over to catch all the things you missed."", 'The last paragraph probably makes “Baby Driver” sound like a music video, and has likely pushed out potential viewers looking for more substance than style. Trust me when I say that Wright doesn’t skimp on the former. There’s enough story and action here to satisfy without the music that drives the filmmaking. Much of the joy of this film is watching it unfold so I’ll be brief with plot. Baby had a brief dalliance with crime, and he made the mistake of robbing from Doc, who now forces him to drive as penance. He’s almost done. He has one more job for Doc and then he’ll be back to his normal life. Of course, we all know how that typically turns out in crime movies. And when Baby meets a lovely waitress named Debora (Lily James), he finds a reason to go straight. That’s all you need to know.', 'At its core, “Baby Driver” recalls decades of movies that anchored their narratives on criminals and the art of the car chase. There’s a remarkably old-fashioned sensibility to the way Wright structures and details his film, and it’s not just because his two genetically blessed stars look like they could have walked out of a 1940s noir (their All-American aesthetic is even more striking in a few gorgeous black-and-white shots that recall old Hollywood even more). “Baby Driver” is a high-concept film that never underwhelms detail, and it’s those charming little beats within the overall tune that hold it together.', 'It helps greatly that few people know how to assemble a cast like Edgar Wright. Elgort and James are engaging, charismatic leads with fantastic chemistry. Unlike most Hollywood action movies, the survival of the heroes here becomes something we actively root for instead of just know is likely to happen. The “villains” of the piece are perfectly cast and directed as well, particularly Spacey and Jamie Foxx as the menacing Bats. Both roles are written and cast in a way that they could have stolen focus with performances that play to the cheap seats but neither actor ever does. Foxx is particularly phenomenal in a role that’s both funny and filled with simmering danger. It’s one of those films where every single role, from the burly diner chef to the sweet post office employee, feels like it was cast with exactly the right person. It creates a sense of additional magic in a film when you can sense that every single element, even the most minor ones, is working exactly as its creator intended.', 'There’s an energy that you can feel in the theater when a movie is really working. It’s the guy next to you jumping a bit in his seat as a car takes a hard corner. It’s the woman behind you laughing extra hard at a joke. It’s the sense that everyone is fully engaged, almost tapping their feet to the rhythm of the film. I still believe this is why most people go to the movies with crowds of strangers—to feel that shared magic and nod their heads in unison to the cinematic tune. “Baby Driver” will be one of your favorite songs of the year. Listen to it with a crowd. And loud.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

The network says there is no relationship to the book whatsoever though the series is called “Blue Bloods.” Apparently the similarity of subject and title is merely a coincidence.', 'That fishy account may not endear intellectual-property lawyers to the show, but for those reluctant to dismiss it out of protest “Blue Bloods” has an old-fashioned appeal both as drama in the vein of a workingman’s “Dynasty” and as splashy procedural. The Reagans of “Blue Bloods” are a sprawling Irish family who gather for Sunday roasts and extend through the five boroughs. Panning shots of New York, from Uptown Manhattan to Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Staten Island, fill the opening sequence and tell us we will travel all over the class spectrum, landing on multiple iterations of the Gotham accent. (Here the Staten Island inflection sounds distinctly Boston.)', 'The Reagan patriarch, Frank, is played by Tom Selleck with such an easy authority that we’re reminded how much we’ve missed him. Frank isn’t merely the managerial papa bear of his brood; he is the city’s police chief and one who has arrived where he is without a lot of political glad-handing. Warning him about a potentially controversial decision, the mayor puts it to him bluntly: “I don’t have to tell you. You don’t have a lot of friends in high places to back you up.”', 'Frank may not have friends in high places, but he has some press friends in horizontal ones. “Blue Bloods” is part of a long list of popular entertainments in which journalists sleep with their sources so routinely that they are professionally analogous to groupies on the trail of ZZ Top. A widower, Frank has kept his bed warm with a blond reporter who shows up at news conferences to give him the full Bob Woodward. Seemingly undeterred about the kind of explosion this might cause on the cover of The New York Post (as it surely would in life), Frank and his lady friend hit the town at night, no obscuring fun-house glasses in evidence.', 'The show’s fundamental misunderstanding of the news media does not end there, no sirree. You know you are watching dark-ages TV when the blogosphere is made out to be some kind of passing novelty, like the ShamWow. Confronting Frank about “blog allegations” that his department works harder at solving murder cases among the wealthy of the East Side than among minorities in poorer neighborhoods, a reporter is admonished by Frank: “Miguel, you’re a professional journalist. You really want to give credence to any amateur blogger with a laptop?” Citizen journalism? Hooey!', '“Blue Bloods,” though, addresses other issues, police brutality among them, more cogently. And it offers a potentially compelling narrative arc in the story line of the family’s youngest son, Jamie (Will Estes), who is asked to go undercover unbeknown to his father to investigate malfeasance in the department.

', 'The best news is that when the three ""Sherlocks"" are over, you\'ll be left, not only with a completely earned cliff-hanger at the end of ""The Great Game,"" but the promise of more episodes in future seasons. ', 'The first of the three episodes, airing Sunday on PBS, is called ""A Study in Pink,"" a sly reference to the first of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes mysteries, ""A Study in Scarlet,"" published in 1887. But we are in present-day London and the fellow without the deerstalker hat and pipe is an oddball with a high IQ, an ever-humming laptop and virtually no social graces. One young Scotland Yard detective simply calls him ""Freak,"" and never gets in trouble with her superiors for doing so.', 'The casting here is thrillingly correct: The young British actor Benedict Cumberbatch, known for roles in ""Atonement"" and other films where he often plays upper-crust misfits, is a Sherlock for the 21st century. ', 'But of course, a Holmes simply must have his Dr. Watson, and in modern times, it would be unlikely for a bumbling, aging medic in the mold of, say, Nigel Bruce to be motivated to follow and abet Holmes. But how about a young doctor, recently retired from the British Army after being wounded while serving in Afghanistan? Seeking a place to live, Watson, played by Martin Freeman, ends up sharing a flat with Holmes and, of course, battling constant exasperation as he becomes involved in his cases which he later ... wait for it ... blogs about.', 'Oh, I know: The purists are already reaching for the smelling salts, but it all works, thanks in large part to the series creators, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss of the more recent ""Doctor Who"" series. The writing is extraordinarily smart - every word of dialogue, delivered at a rapid-fire pace, every oblique reference to elements of the original Holmes stories. If you know your Conan Doyle, you\'ll appreciate that Moffat and Gatiss do not ""write down"" to viewers who only recall a Basil Rathbone movie or two from the past. Not knowing the original, however, isn\'t a handicap at all: The creators and their writers know how to tell a ripping yarn, not to mention how to create irresistible characterizations.', '""A Study in Pink"" turns on a rash of supposed suicides in London, which Holmes quickly determines to be murders. But who is making these seemingly unrelated people poison themselves? The title refers to one of the victims, found dressed entirely in pink - even her cell phone is pink (Holmes appropriates it after solving the murders).', 'The second film is just a tad weaker than the other two. ""The Blind Banker"" evokes the ""mysterious Orient"" made popular in mysteries of the early 20th century, as Holmes and Watson find themselves in London\'s Chinatown battling a crime syndicate known as the Black Lotus as they attempt to discover how a banker and a journalist were killed in rooms that were locked from the inside. ', 'But the real wrinkle here is that Watson attempts to have a personal life, which seems to both annoy and fascinate Holmes. One of the small running subthemes in the series is that Holmes and Watson are sometimes mistaken as more than just flat-mates, which only irritates Watson but seems to unnerve Holmes just a bit, as much as anything can ever be said to unnerve Holmes. ', 'Of course, this bit of business points up the absence of any sort of personal life for Holmes in most adaptations. In the original stories, Watson eventually married, but returned to 221B Baker St. after his wife died. What we know of Holmes is only that he has a brother, Mycroft, who is older and works as a civil servant. We also know that the original Holmes was fond of smoking pipes and the occasional cigarette. Here, however, in a nod toward contemporary sensibilities, Sherlock is trying valiantly to quit ... by wearing three nicotine patches at once. ', 'Of course of all the elements of the Conan Doyle stories, the one missing until the third episode, ""The Great Game,"" is Holmes\' archenemy, Professor Moriarty. He\'s mentioned in passing, but shows up in person only when Holmes and Watson work against the clock trying to solve little mysteries, imparted to them by complete strangers who happen to be girdled by explosives that will detonate if Holmes can\'t solve the riddles in time.

No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.', 'The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): “Don’t ever take sides against the family.”', 'It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone’s daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter’s rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.', '“I went to the police, like a good American,” the man says. The Godfather’s reply will underpin the entire movie: “Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you’d come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.”', 'As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather’s darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather’s world.', 'The screenplay of “The Godfather” follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told “someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .” and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito’s desire to spare his wife the sight of their son’s maimed body. And notice how a woman’s “mistaken” phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It’s done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out.', 'Now here is a trivia question: What is the name of Vito’s wife? She exists in the movie as an insignificant shadow, a plump Sicilian grandmother who poses with her husband in wedding pictures but plays no role in the events that take place in his study. There is little room for women in “The Godfather.” Sonny uses and discards them, and ignores his wife. Connie (Talia Shire), the Don’s daughter, is so disregarded that her husband is not allowed into the family business. He is thrown a bone--”a living”--and later, when he is killed, Michael coldly lies to his sister about what happened.', 'The irony of the title is that it eventually comes to refer to the son, not the father. As the film opens Michael is not part of the family business, and plans to marry a WASP, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). His turning point comes when he saves his father’s life by moving his hospital bed, and whispers to the unconscious man: “I’m with you now.”', 'After he shoots the corrupt cop, Michael hides in Sicily, where he falls in love with and marries Appolonia (Simonetta Stefanelli). They do not speak the same language; small handicap for a Mafia wife. He undoubtedly loves Appolonia, as he loved Kay, but what is he thinking here: that he can no longer marry Kay because he has chosen a Mafia life? After Appolonia’s death and his return to America, he seeks out Kay and eventually they marry. Did he tell her about Appolonia? Such details are unimportant to the story.', 'What is important is loyalty to the family. Much is said in the movie about trusting a man’s word, but honesty is nothing compared to loyalty. Michael doesn’t even trust Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) with the secret that he plans to murder the heads of the other families. The famous “baptism massacre” is tough, virtuoso filmmaking: The baptism provides him with an airtight alibi, and he becomes a godfather in both senses at the same time.', 'Vito Corleone is the moral center of the film. He is old, wise and opposed to dealing in drugs. He understands that society is not alarmed by “liquor, gambling . . . even women.” But drugs are a dirty business to Don Vito, and one of the movie’s best scenes is the Mafia summit at which he argues his point. The implication is that in the godfather’s world there would be no drugs, only “victimless crimes,” and justice would be dispatched evenly and swiftly.', 'My argument is taking this form because I want to point out how cleverly Coppola structures his film to create sympathy for his heroes. The Mafia is not a benevolent and protective organization, and the Corleone family is only marginally better than the others. Yet when the old man falls dead among his tomato plants, we feel that a giant has passed.', 'Gordon Willis’ cinematography is celebrated for its darkness; it is rich, atmospheric, expressive. You cannot appreciate this on television because the picture is artificially brightened. Coppola populates his dark interior spaces with remarkable faces. The front-line actors--Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall--are attractive in one way or another, but those who play their associates are chosen for their fleshy, thickly lined faces--for huge jaws and deeply set eyes. Look at Abe Vigoda as Tessio, the fearsome enforcer. The first time we see him, he’s dancing with a child at the wedding, her satin pumps balanced on his shoes. The sun shines that day, but never again: He is developed as a hulking presence who implies the possibility of violent revenge. Only at the end is he brightly lit again, to make him look vulnerable as he begs for his life.', 'The Brando performance is justly famous and often imitated. We know all about his puffy cheeks, and his use of props like the kitten in the opening scene. Those are actor’s devices. Brando uses them but does not depend on them: He embodies the character so convincingly that at the end, when he warns his son two or three times that “the man who comes to you to set up a meeting--that’s the traitor,” we are not thinking of acting at all. We are thinking that the Don is growing old and repeating himself, but we are also thinking that he is probably absolutely right.', 'Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. All of the other roles are so successfully filled that a strange thing happened as I watched this restored 1997 version: Familiar as I am with Robert Duvall, when he first appeared on the screen I found myself thinking, “There’s Tom Hagen.”', 'Coppola went to Italy to find Nino Rota, composer of many Fellini films, to score the picture. Hearing the sadness and nostalgia of the movie’s main theme, I realized what the music was telling us: Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

It’s a place where there are no rules beyond the ones people invent for themselves to survive—stretches of Texas and New Mexico that are equal parts brutal and beautiful.', 'Sheridan previously explored this terrain as the writer of Denis Villeneuve’s “Sicario” and David Mackenzie’s “Hell or High Water,” the latter of which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Now, he’s directing for only the second time as well as writing with “Wind River,” which feels very much of a piece with those two previous films, even as it distinguishes itself with a vivid sense of place.', '“Wind River” is full of vast, scrubby expanses that give way to pristine blankets of white, interrupted only by a snowmobile slashing a solitary path. You can hear the crunch of snow and feel the bitter chill, which runs so deep that it can be deadly. Sheridan drops us in and we know this place immediately; his storytelling is meaty but efficient, and his pacing moves along at a steadily engrossing clip before ultimately exploding in a startling blast of violence.', 'A moody procedural, “Wind River” is heavy with symbolism from the start—perhaps, too much so. When we first see Jeremy Renner’s Cory Lambert, a tracker well-versed in the Wyoming wilds, he’s lying on his belly in the snow, camouflaged with his rifle, picking off wolves that have been preying on sheep. He’s a protector because it’s his job, but as we learn throughout the course of the film, that calling has become deeply personal.', 'There’s specificity to the way the characters talk, a poetry that can be quite moving or it can clang on the ear. But Sheridan’s script can be just as powerful in its quiet moments like these—in what the characters don’t say to each other.', 'On one of Cory’s hunting expeditions, he comes across the frozen body of a young woman; we’d seen her at the film’s start, frantically running barefoot in the middle of the night under a crisp, full moon. He recognizes her as Natalie (Kelsey Asbille), the best friend of his teenage daughter, who also died mysteriously a few years earlier.', 'Since the death occurred on the Wind River reservation—and Natalie, like Cory’s daughter, was Native American—the tribal police get involved in the investigation, led by the great Graham Greene as the dryly humorous, no-nonsense chief. But so, too, do the feds, in the form of newbie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). She’s been sent from the Las Vegas office and is so ill-equipped for this place and this weather that she has to borrow snow gear—from the closet of Cory’s late daughter, which adds to the prevailing sense of grief.', '“This isn’t the land of backup, Jane,” he says to her in explaining life on the reservation. “This is the land of: You’re on your own.”', 'And so as Cory works with Jane to unravel the mystery of what happened to Natalie in this remote, secretive land, he also must finally face what happened to his own child. (Cinematographer Ben Richardson, whose work includes the ravishing and dreamlike “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” helped create the richly atmospheric visuals.)', 'Sheridan handles the relationship between Jane and Cory deftly: They’re equals, but they also need and learn from each other. And while fellow Avengers Renner and Olsen have a natural, understated chemistry, Sheridan mercifully doesn’t throw their characters together in an awkward, needless romance.', 'Renner also has several powerful scenes with Gil Birmingham (who played a crucial supporting role in “Hell or High Water”) as Natalie’s grieving father, Martin. He’s all masculine stoicism and bitter swagger until he isn’t, and watching his proud veneer crumble is shattering.', 'At times, Sheridan has his characters spell out a little too clearly what they’re thinking and feeling, and that’s often the case in the exchanges between Cory and Martin. But the words are so beautiful and come from such a place of deep truth, it’s hard not to be moved, and they help give “Wind River” a simultaneous sense of timelessness and immediacy.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

They dispense justice and regulate the crime and dangerous dealings in the town. Clay (Ron Perlman) is the leader of SAMCRO, and his step-son Jax (Charlie Hunnam) is his second in command. However, with a changing of the guard in the sheriff’s office and an ATF investigation breathing down their necks, the Sons of Anarchy are facing some new challenges that threaten to tear the organization apart. ', 'WHAT I LIKED\nAlthough “Sons of Anarchy” is not broadcast on the well known pay networks like HBO or Showtime, it has made a strong name for itself as an FX series. Like its gritty predecessors like “The Shield,” “Sons of Anarchy” takes an unflinching look at justice by outlaws. In this sense, it’s one of the more hard core shows on television, even though it has more censor limits than the premium stations.', 'We’ve seen the general idea behind “Sons of Anarchy” before, most notably with “The Sopranos,” in which the outlaws are the ones with the most power. However, “Sons of Anarchy” gives us a unique perspective to it. At its heart, this show has more in common than an old-school western. Just swap out hogs for horses, and you’ve got a pretty modern take on frontier justice. ', 'The key to this show is the gray characters. It’s hard to say that anyone in the series is a good guy in that they all do nefarious things. Certain characters, like Jax, are the most noble, living by his own code. However, Clay also has his moments, being a father to the “Sons” and the town itself. ', '“Sons of Anarchy” relies on character tension, between Jax and his assorted love interests, between Gemma (Katey Sagal) and Clay, between the various members of the Sons of Anarchy. This is not a soft show by any stretch of the imagination. It’s full of testosterone and harsh scenes of violence. However, there are plenty of moments of levity, including a particular character with a chronic pleasure problem and some comic relief moments at the hands of some secondary characters. ', 'Like “The Shield,” “Sons of Anarchy” is a powerful drama, and it deals with many unpleasant topics – from gun running to vigilante justice. And I’ll be honest… I haven’t seen anything quite like it on television in years. ', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nMost of the characters on the show are appealing in their own ways. They may not always be likeable, but they are definitely compelling and interesting. Unfortunately, there are some weak spots in the mix, and they can be high profile characters. In particular, the character of Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff), who is a doctor trying to start a new life in Charming and who starts a relationship with Jax, comes off weak. She has an excellent arc in the middle of the season which involves her being personally stalked by a federal agent, but overall her character just doesn’t interest me. ', 'There’s a lot of backstory to the characters that was probably dealt with in the original unaired pilot, so it does take some concentration to follow the characters, especially in the beginning. However, you can pick up all the characters’ histories if you pay attention to all the episodes. ', '\nBLU-RAY FEATURES\nAlthough the bonus features are a little slim for such a high-profile first season, there is still plenty of excellent material on the Blu-ray. Select episodes include commentary by the filmmakers, and there are plenty of deleted scenes from the season. ', '“The Making of Sons of Anarchy, Season 1” is a short featurette that gives the background of the show and how creator Kurt Sutter developed the series with his experience with the real thing. Additional featurettes include “Casting Sons of Anarchy” which spotlights the different characters and how they were chosen from the audition process, “The Ink” which explains the tattoos of the various gangs and “The Bikes” which details how each character has been given his own unique set of wheels. ', 'Wrapping things up is “Anarchy on the Set,” a gag reel that includes plenty more cursing than you’ll even see on the show. ', 'Michlle, I just started watching Sons of Anarchy, I’m on season 3 episode 5″ So as far as I got to on the show I  it so far . I been waiting it on Shomi  .

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'The odds seem stacked in ""Logan Lucky""\'s favor\xa0the instant you spot ""Directed by Steven Soderbergh"" in the opening credits. Sure enough, it\'s a winner. Soderbergh is one of the reigning masters of the heist picture: he did the ""Ocean\'s Eleven"" remake and its two sequels, plus ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Underneath."" This one\'s about a bunch of good ol’ boys trying to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina, but the vibe is so similar to Soderbergh\'s hit heist trilogy that a TV newscaster fesses up by describing the gang in this one as ""Ocean\'s 7-Eleven."" The movie is put together with the no-fuss confidence of Soderbergh\'s best entertainments, staging comedic banter and suspense sequences with equal assurance, even playing sly perception games with the audience by making you wonder how smart or dumb the characters (and the movie) actually are. ', 'The story centers on two brothers, both wounded war veterans. Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), a onetime coal miner, lost a leg in the service. Jimmy’s younger brother Clyde (Adam Driver) lost part of an arm, and now tends bar at a roadside saloon where Jimmy is a regular. An obnoxious customer jokes that if you put the Logan boys together, you’d get a whole person. That\'s not too far off the mark: like redneck cousins of George Clooney and Brad Pitt\'s characters in the ""Ocean\'s"" movies, they amplify each other\'s better qualities, and maintain a united front even when they disagree. Legend has it that the Logan family, which also includes a badass, hot-car-driving kid sister named Mellie (Riley Keough), is cursed. Throughout ""Logan Lucky,"" you keep wondering if the curse will rear its head and ruin the plan Jimmy has cooked up with Clyde and a third partner, an imprisoned explosives expert named Joe Bang (Daniel Craig) who\'s five months away from release.', 'It’s a heck of a scheme. Seems the Charlotte Motor Speedway has a sinkhole problem, and Jimmy was part of the team of ex-coal miners brought in to fix it. While toiling beneath the stadium, he learned that concession stand earnings are delivered to a cash vault deep in the basement by way of pneumatic tubes. The Logans promise that with a little help from Joe they can break into the vault, steal the cash, and walk away rich. Joe says he’d be happy to join the team if he weren’t, as he sneers, ""In...CAR...cer...a...TED."" No biggie. The Logan boys offer to bust Joe out of prison long enough to join the heist, then sneak him back in. ', 'At this point you may start to wonder how smart the Logans actually are and how seriously we\'re supposed to take their boasting. There are two kinds of people who make promises like the ones the Logans make to Joe Bang: hotshots and idiots. The characters in this film are drawn with broad enough strokes that they could go either way. The Logans and the Bangs—including Joe\'s younger brothers, Sam and Fish (Brian Gleeson and Jack Quaid), one of whom claims to be a computer expert who knows ""all the Twitters""—are a loquacious bunch of misfits and scalawags, nervy as hell. But sometimes they sound like characters from one of those Coen brothers movies filled with dimwitted braggarts—think ""Raising Arizona""\xa0or ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""—and each one has a different accent.  Driver sounds like Forrest Gump eating peanut butter, Craig has the barbecued hambone drawl of a sheriff from a 1970s hicksploitation picture, and there are times when Tatum seems to forget to have one. Only Keough, the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, seems as rooted in life as  the screenplay\'s references to NASCAR fandom, the child beauty pageant circuit, contaminated groundwater, and the fall of  the mining industry. ', 'You may also wonder if this is the  kind of film that believes in curses. Some films do, some don\'t, and others leave you guessing. There are no curses in ""The Sting"" or ""Ocean’s Eleven,"" but characters in Coen brothers\xa0films often do seem cursed, not just by their own overconfidence or stupidity, but by coincidence, misunderstanding or fate. Things go well enough early on in ""Logan Lucky"" that you start wondering about the movie\'s point of view on destiny, bad mojo, and the like. Is the movie\'s title sincere, ironic, or neither?', 'All questions are answered in due time. The screenplay is credited to Rebecca Blunt, supposedly a young first-timer getting her big break, but it’s an open secret that it was really written by Soderbergh’s wife Jules Asner, who hails from West Virginia. She partly based Jimmy, a faded high school football star, on Channing Tatum, who grew up poor in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, and was headed for a college football scholarship until he wrecked his knee and turned to stripping and modeling instead (see the Tatum/Soderbergh ""Magic Mike"" collaborations). ', ""Soderbergh directs the script (and edited and shot it under pseudonyms—a Soderbergh family tradition, it seems) with his characteristic smoothness, moving through the story so deftly that you don't realize you've already gone from point A to point B until you're  already en route to point C. There’s no wasted motion. Everything  happens as it does for a reason. There are points where you might assume that the film is rushing through incidents that it can’t adequately explain or justify, or just flat-out forgetting to give details that would make a character’s actions make sense. But that proves not to be the case. The film gives out information on a need-to-know basis: if you don’t need it, you won’t know it.  "", 'This need-to-know  aesthetic carries all the way down to the level of individual shots. Soderbergh\'s camera is  constantly framing scenes and moving through space in order to conceal or reveal information  about the characters\' motives and the progress of the heist. Some shots are structured like well-wrought jokes—one where you think you  know where the story is headed, then laugh out loud when it takes you someplace  else. A lot of times you have no idea what you\'re looking at or why it\'s important until Soderbergh moves a bit to the left or shifts focus to make you go, ""Aha!"" There are few working directors who still know how to make a film this way. Soderbergh is one of them. ', '""Logan Lucky"" is not a deep or particularly original film and isn\'t trying to be, and there are moments when you might wish that it had taken an extra scene or beat to flesh out its oddball characters and give them more than two dimensions (though there are moments—the one set at a school recital, in particular—that do exactly that). And a couple of characters who are introduced with great fanfare (notably a clinic worker played by Katherine Waterston, and an FBI agent played by Hilary Swank who snarls like Clint Eastwood) don\'t make as much of an impression as they should. But it\'s precision-tooled entertainment made by experts, and sometimes more than that. Watching it is like finding money in the pocket of a coat that you haven’t worn in years.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'It’s hard to say whether “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” about a group of teenagers who turn into videogame characters, is a sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams hit “Jumanji,” a remake, a reboot, or something else. But it’s definitely the kind of movie that works the name of a classic rock song into its title and makes sure to blast it during the end credits, so that people who were in their twenties during the 1990s and now have kids of their own (and probably took them to this film) can feel that Pavlovian tingle.\xa0', 'That description makes the new “Jumanji” sound like a cash-grab, and in lot of ways it is—studios are so enamored with the notion that pre-existing intellectual properties are box office insurance that they’re far more likely to greenlight this than something genuinely new, even though exactly no one has spent the last two decades saying, “I wish somebody would make another ‘Jumanji.’” At the same time, though, this is a\xa0likable, funny diversion, and sometimes more than that. It has enough twists and surprises to pull viewers along, despite the fact that writer-director Jake Kasdan’s story (co-written with four people) is ultimately not much meatier than the one from a 1990s videogame that the characters end up inhabiting after getting sentenced to a “Breakfast Club”-type detention at school. (In the original film, the titular diversion is an old-fashioned board game, just like in the source material, Chris van Allsburg’s popular children’s book.)', 'The protagonists here are\xa0Spencer (Alex Wolff), an earnest nerd; Spencer’s onetime best friend Fridge (Ser’Darius Blain), a football star who ends up grounded after authorities realize Alex wrote a homework assignment for him; Bethany (Madison Iseman), a classic snotty Heather-type who’s addicted to her smartphone and takes selfies constantly; and the bookish, socially anxious Martha (Morgan Turner). They all have insecurities and issues. Once they end up inside the Jumanji videogame, these same characters are played by Dwayne Johnson (as Spencer the nerd); Kevin Hart (as Fridge the jock); Karen Gillan (as the super-fit avatar of Martha), and Jack Black, of all people, as Bethany. There are supposed to be five characters in the game-space, though, and we meet the fifth in due time: Alex Vreeke (Nick Jonas), who is introduced as an energetic teenager in the film’s 1996 prologue, only to get sucked into the game and become The Local Missing Boy whose endlessly grieving family still lives in their now-decrepit house.\xa0', 'The body-switching gag threatens to wear out its welcome quickly (hah ha, the scrawny nerd looks like Dwayne Johnson now, and the awkward girl has washboard abs!), but the actors take their assignments to play teenagers so seriously that the film surfs along on a wave of poker-faced earnestness, mixing moments of pathos in with its super-broad slapstick. (Except for Dan Castellaneta’s Homer Simpson, nobody screams in pain more hilariously than Kevin Hart.) At certain points you might feel as though you’re watching the longest, most lavishly produced “Saturday\xa0Night Live” sketch ever, complete with lush jungle scenery (the film was shot partly on location in Hawaii) and attacks by CGI hippos, rhinos, monkeys, crocodiles and the like.\xa0But since the entire thing plays like a 10-year old’s Disney Channel fantasy of what adolescence will be like, it works well enough, especially when coupled with intense discussions of the game’s rules (how many lives you get, how many levels there are, how to lift the curse from the land, etc).\xa0', ""Both the videogame’s construction and its gender politics are very ‘90s. The movie is aware of this and makes fun of it, though there’s a bit of an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too aspect to the way it puts Johnson and Gillan's bodies on display. There are occasional jolts of mayhem, thanks mainly to the motorcycle-riding ninjas who do the bidding of the movie’s villain John Van Pelt (Bobby Cannavale), a demonic figure who wants to control the Jaguar’s Eye and claim dominion over the land. The action scenes are constructed with a bit of panache and manage to be exciting though you’re never seriously worried that any major character is going to lose all of their lives. Kasdan, a veteran filmmaker who happens to be the son of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “The Empire Strikes Back” screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan, has an old-school sense of how to build those kinds of sequences. The shots are thoughtfully composed, for the most part, and you always know where you are and what's at stake from moment to moment."", 'The script’s scenarios allow for charming, often faintly surreal funny character moments, as when Black’s round yet flouncy Bethany instructs Gillan’s super-fit but still physically awkward Martha on how to be sexy. Black’s ""hey, sailor"" walk evokes Bugs Bunny in drag, and Gillan’s subsequent “seductive” dance to distract some guards looks as if she’s trying to shake sand out of her shorts while simultaneously dealing with a bad case of swimmer’s ear. The film doesn’t have the nerve to follow some of its more subversive ideas (such as Bethany lusting after Alex) to their logical conclusions, probably because this is an expensive project that’s terrified of alienating a certain sector of the public (imagine the walkouts if Jack Black lip-locked with Nick Jonas in something other than a CPR situation). But it’s still more surprising in more ways than it had to be, and the performers are clearly having such fun playing insecure teenagers that you stay involved even when the thinness of the enterprise becomes undeniable. This is a two-and-a-half star movie, honestly, bumped up a notch because the actors are likable, the film doesn’t have a cruel thought in its head, and the sentimental finale feels earned.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

Martin’s series of books, “A Song of Ice and Fire,” fell in love and sought to adapt “Game of Thrones,” one of the installments.', 'The show has been elaborately made to the point that producers turned to a professional at something called the Language Creation Society to design a vocabulary for the savage Dothraki nomads who provide some of the more Playboy-TV-style plot points and who are forced to speak in subtitles. Like “The Tudors” and “The Borgias” on Showtime and the “Spartacus” series on Starz, “Game of Thrones,” is a costume-drama sexual hopscotch, even if it is more sophisticated than its predecessors. It says something about current American attitudes toward sex that with the exception of the lurid and awful “Californication,” nearly all eroticism on television is past tense. The imagined historical universe of “Game of Thrones” gives license for unhindered bed-jumping — here sibling intimacy is hardly confined to emotional exchange.', 'The true perversion, though, is the sense you get that all of this illicitness has been tossed in as a little something for the ladies, out of a justifiable fear, perhaps, that no woman alive would watch otherwise. While I do not doubt that there are women in the world who read books like Mr. Martin’s, I can honestly say that I have never met a single woman who has stood up in indignation at her book club and refused to read the latest from Lorrie Moore unless everyone agreed to “The Hobbit” first. “Game of Thrones” is boy fiction patronizingly turned out to reach the population’s other half.', 'Since the arrival of “The Sopranos” more than a decade ago, HBO has distinguished itself as a corporate auteur committed, when it is as its most intelligent and dazzling, to examining the way that institutions are made and how they are upheld or fall apart: the Mafia, municipal government (“The Wire”), the Roman empire (“Rome”), the American West (“Deadwood”), religious fundamentalism (“Big Love”).', 'When the network ventures away from its instincts for real-world sociology, as it has with the vampire saga “True Blood,” things start to feel cheap, and we feel as though we have been placed in the hands of cheaters. “Game of Thrones” serves up a lot of confusion in the name of no larger or really relevant idea beyond sketchily fleshed-out notions that war is ugly, families are insidious and power is hot. If you are not averse to the Dungeons & Dragons aesthetic, the series might be worth the effort.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Writer/director Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is a sprawling, incident- and character-packed extravaganza that picks up at the end of “Star Wars: Episode\xa0VII -\xa0The Force Awakens” and guides the series into unfamiliar territory. It’s everything a fan could want from a “Star Wars” film and then some. Even the sorts of viewers who spend the entire running time of movies anticipating every plot twist and crowing “called it!” when they get one right are likely to come up short here. But the surprises usually don’t violate the (admittedly loose) internal logic of the universe George Lucas invented, and when they seem to, it’s because the movie has expanded the mythology in a small but significant way, or imported a sliver of something from another variant of Lucas’ creation (Genddy Tartakovsky’s magnificent TV series “Clone Wars” seems to have influenced the last act). \xa0   ', ""The first part of “The Last\xa0Jedi” cross-cuts between the remnants of our heroes’ ragtag fleet (led by the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia) running away from the First Order, aka the next-generation version of the Empire; and Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the aquatic planet Ahch-To (gesundheit!) trying to convince the self-exiled Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, whose sandblasted face becomes truly iconic in close-ups) to overcome his grief at failing a group of young Jedi trainees and rejoin the Resistance. The New Order's Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis plus CGI) has grand plans for both Rey and his Darth Vader-obsessed apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The leathery old coot may not be a great bad guy—he’s too much of a standard-issue deep-voiced sadist, in a Marvel mode—but he is quite the chess player, and so is Johnson.   \xa0   "", 'I’m being vague here on purpose. Suffice to say that, despite being comprised of variations on things we’ve been experiencing directly (in “Star Wars” films) and indirectly (in “Star Wars”-inspired entertainment) since 1977, “The Last\xa0Jedi” still manages to maneuver in unexpected ways, starting with the decision to build a whole film around a retreat where the goal is not to win but to avoid being wiped out.   Along that narrative backbone “The Last\xa0Jedi” strings what amount to several tight, often hastily devised mini-missions, each of\xa0which either moves the heroes (or villains) closer to their goals or blows up in their faces. The story resolves in lengthy, consecutive climaxes which, refreshingly, don’t play like a cynical attempt to pad things out. Old business is resolved, new business introduced. ', 'And from scene to scene, Johnson gives veteran characters (Chewbacca and R2-D2 especially) and those who debuted in “The Force Awakens” enough screen time to showcase them at their best while also introducing compelling new faces (including a heroic maintenance worker, Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico; a serene and tough vice admiral in the Resistance, played by Laura Dern; a sort of “safecracker” character played by Benicio Del Toro).\xa0   ', '“Jedi” does a better job than most sequels of giving the audience both\xa0what it wants and\xa0what it didn’t know it wanted.\xa0The movie leans hard into sentiment, most of it planted in the previous installment, some related to the unexpected passing of one of its leads (Fisher—thank goodness they gave her a lot of screen time here, and thrilling things to do). But whenever it allows a character to cry (or invites us to) the catharsis feels earned. It happens rather often—this being a film preoccupied with grieving for the past and transcending it, populated by hounded and broken people who are afraid hope will be snuffed out.\xa0 ', 'Rey’s anguish at not knowing who her parents are and Kylo Ren’s trauma at killing his own father to advance toward his ""destiny"" literally as well as figuratively mirror each other. Lifting a bit of business glimpsed briefly in “The Empire Strikes Back” and ""Return of the Jedi,"" Johnson lets these all-powerful characters telepathically “speak” to each other across space as easily as you or I might Skype with a friend. This gimmick offers so much potential for drama and wry humor that you might wonder why nobody did it earlier.\xa0   ', 'Sometimes ""The Last\xa0Jedi"" violates our expectations in a cheeky way that stops short of telling super-fans to get over themselves. There’s a touch of “Spaceballs” and “Robot Chicken” to some of the jokes. Snoke orders Kylo to “take off that ridiculous helmet,” Luke chastises an old friend for showing a nostalgic video by muttering “That was a cheap move,” and an early gag finds one of the heroes calling the bridge of a star destroyer and pretending to be stuck on hold. This aspect adds a much-needed dash of self-deprecating humor (“The Force Awakens” was often a stitch as well, especially when Han Solo, Chewbacca, BB-8 and John Boyega’s James Garner-like hero/coward Finn were onscreen), but without going so meta that ""The Last\xa0Jedi"" turns into a smart-alecky thesis paper on itself. ', 'The movie works equally well as an earnest adventure full of passionate heroes and villains  and a meditation on sequels and franchise properties. Like “The Force Awakens,” only more so, this one is preoccupied with questions of legacy, legitimacy and succession, and includes multiple debates over whether one should replicate or reject the stories and symbols of the past. Among its many valuable lessons is that objects have no worth save for the feelings we invest in them, and\xa0that\xa0no\xa0individual\xa0is greater than a noble idea.', 'Johnson has made some very good theatrical features, but the storytelling here owes the most to his work on TV’s “Breaking Bad,” a playfully convoluted crime drama that approached each new installment with the street illusionist’s panache: the source of delight was always in the hand you weren’t looking at. There are points where the film appears to have miscalculated or made an outright lame choice (this becomes worrisome in the middle, when Dern’s Admiral Holdo and Oscar Isaac’s hotshot pilot Poe Dameron are at loggerheads), but then you realize that it was a setup for another payoff that lands harder because you briefly doubted that “The\xa0Last\xa0Jedi” does, in fact, know what it’s doing.\xa0   ', ""This determination to split the difference between surprise and inevitability is encoded in “The Last\xa0Jedi” down to the level of scenes and shots. How many Star Destroyers, TIE fighters, Imperial walkers, lightsabers, escape pods, and discussions of the nature of The Force have we seen by now? Oodles. But Johnson manages to find a way to present the technology, mythology and imagery in a way that makes it feel new, or at least new-ish, starting with a shot of Star Destroyers materializing from hyperspace in the sky over a planet (as seen from ground level) and continuing through images of Rebel ships being raked apart by Imperial cannon fire like cans on a shooting range and, hilariously, a blurry video conference in which the goggle-eyed warrior-philosopher Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) delivers important information while engaging in a shootout with unseen foes. (She calls it a “union matter.”)\xa0"", 'There’s greater attention paid here to color and composition than in any entry since “The Empire Strikes Back.” Particularly dazzling are Snoke’s throne room, with its Dario Argento-red walls and red-armored guards, and the final battle, set on a salt planet whose flat white surfaces get ripped up to reveal shades of crimson. (Seen from a distance, the battlefield itself seems to be bleeding.) The architecture of the action sequences is something to behold. A self-enclosed setpiece in the opening space battle is more emotionally powerful than any action sequence in any blockbuster this year, save the ""No Man\'s Land"" sequence of ""Wonder Woman,"" and it\'s centered on a character we just met. \xa0', 'There are spots where the film can’t figure out how to get the characters to where it needs them to be and just sort of shrugs and says, “And then this happened, now\xa0let’s get on with it.” But there are fewer such moments than you might have gone in prepared to forgive—and really, if that sort of thing were a cinematic crime, Howard Hawks would have gotten the chair. Most importantly, the damned thing moves, both in a plot sense and in the sense of a skilled choreographer-dancer who has visualized every millisecond of his routine and practiced it to the point where grace seems to come as easily as breathing.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Frustratingly not-quite-there from start to finish, the paranoia-soaked railroad thriller ""The Commuter"" is the latest installment in the unofficial ""Liam Neeson Late Winter Butt Kickers"" series. The LNLWBKs started in January 2009, with the surprise smash ""Taken,"" and continued with more ""Taken"" movies, plus three Neeson adventures by Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of this new one (""Unknown,""\xa0""Non-Stop"" and ""Run All Night"" were the others). They\'re a staple of our moviegoing diet by this point, nearly as ingrained in the seasonal calendar as the holidays themselves.  Like nearly every entry, this new one is worth seeing for the unfussy determination of Neeson, a couple of impressively choreographed action sequences (in particular a one-take, hand-to-hand fight that attempts to one-up the famous hammer sequence in ""Oldboy""), and an intriguing premise that the filmmakers never manage to fully exploit. By ""worth seeing,"" I don\'t necessarily mean ""rush to the nearest theater, forsaking all else,"" but rather, ""if this comes on TV, you\'ll probably watch the whole thing, as long as you\'re not in a hurry to be somewhere."" Who knows, it might even be ideal train viewing. The plot has all the hallmarks of a daydream that got obsessively worked-over for years during somebody\'s daily rides to and from work.', ""Neeson's character, Michael MacCauley, is a 60-year-old ex-cop turned insurance salesman who works in midtown Manhattan. His boss tells him that he's being fired right when he's about to begin his return trip home to see his wife (Elizabeth McGovern, who deserves better than this) and college-aged son (Dean-Charles Chapman) in Westchester, Long Island. Michael loses his phone in the train station due to a pickpocket he doesn't realize bumped him on purpose, then meets a mysterious stranger (Vera Farmiga) who tells him he has to locate a certan passenger on the commuter train before it arrives at its final stop and plant a tracking device on him/her, at which point that person will be killed. Michael will get $25,000 up front and another $75,000 upon completion of the mission—enough to offset the economic havoc wrought by his firing, including the potential scuttling of a reverse-mortgage on the family home that would've paid for his son's college. "", ""This is one of those moral conundrums that really only generates suspense if you believe that a\xa0working class hero who radiates decency would condemn another person to death for $100,000. Nevertheless, Neeson goes the extra kilometer trying to sell us on the character's economic desperation as well as his macho pride (Michael couldn't bring himself to tell his wife and kids that he just got fired, so there's pressure to make this right immediately so he'll never have to spill the truth). "", 'Director Collet-Serra, who did the mostly terrific shark thriller ""The Shallows"" and seems to have a knack for stripped-down, goal-directed action flicks, has clearly absorbed Alfred Hitchcock films where the action occurs on the boundary separating the real from the metaphorical or dreamlike. The kaleidoscope of humanity that Michael meets on the train is a touch of ""Rear Window,"" the arrangement between him and Farmiga\'s character is a faint echo of ""Strangers on a Train,"" and there\'s a hint of ""North by Northwest"" in the notion of a (mostly) ordinary New Yorker getting pulled into a conspiracy and struggling to regain control over his life. In the end, though, this is a tweedy suburban version of a confined-space action flick. Michael is on his own the whole time. Any allies he picks up along the way are temporary, and not all can be trusted.', "" The class-warfare, eat-the-rich messaging feels rather slapped-on, though, and the movie never gets close to generating the political framework it would have needed to to be taken seriously as a parable of this or that, as opposed to yet another movie where Liam Neeson beats people up. It should be assumed that there are no extraneous scenes in a film like this—by which I mean that, if you meet Michael's ex-partner (Patrick Wilson) and their former supervisor (Sam Neill) early in the story, and get a couple of moments where Michael talks about the economic collapse of 2008, and a scene that ends with Michael giving the finger to a jerkbag of a stockbroker, and one where Michael looks up from a bar to see a TV news story about officials being arrested on corruption charges, you can bet it will all come together in the end, haphazardly. No one involved in the production seemed to think we'd care about clarity when it came to stuff like this. They weren't entirely wrong, but the articulation is still wanting: why even do this kind of politically allegorical action picture if you're not going to, y'know, really do it? Like, with feeling? "", 'I did care very much about Neeson\'s character, though, thanks mainly to his mastery of the same ""just say your lines and hit your marks"" style of film acting. No matter who he\'s playing in these movies, he always attacks the problem at hand with the low-key focus of a guy trying really hard to open a stuck jar of jam. It\'s my considered opinion that Neeson\'s late-career brand of business class dad machismo has yet to meet a director that can fully do it justice, but reasonable minds may differ. In any case, it\'s doubtful that any will be debating the fine points of his late-career filmography when Michael is hanging underneath a moving train like Indiana Jones, or breaking the little glass box at the end of a car so that he can use the hammer on someone\'s skull.

We’re fighting Klingons again! There’s a mutiny from the show’s protagonist! Wait, what? But I thought the captain was the mutineer’s mentor? Shh, shh, “Star Trek” is on television again. (Not quite, though. If you want to find out how it all turns out, now you have to pay for CBS All Access.) The casting — especially Sonequa Martin-Green as the show’s protagonist, Michael Burnham — is well done. (The writing of her character, however — more on that later.)', 'For better or worse, “Discovery” is already a departure from past “Trek” series, both in style and serialized substance. This is not your Vulcan father’s “Star Trek.”', 'Usually, “Star Trek” pilots have some sort of handoff between characters from previous shows. For example, in the pilot for “The Next Generation,” Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), at this point an admiral, walked the halls with Data (Brent Spiner) exploring the new Enterprise (“You treat her like a lady. And she’ll always bring you home.”) Captain Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) handed off the baton to Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) in “Deep Space Nine.”', 'Quark (Armin Shimerman), the bartender from Deep Space Nine, shows up in the pilot for “Voyager.” Zephram Cochrane (James Cromwell), previously seen in the film “Star Trek First Contact,” sends off the crew of the Enterprise NX-01 in the first episode of “Enterprise.”', 'Instead of a character, though, the “Discovery” handoff seems to be lens flares. (O.K., fine, and Sarek, Spock’s father.) That’s the visual style that J.J. Abrams introduced to the universe with his 2009 “Star Trek” reboot. There are the tilted and shaky camera shots zoomed in on character’s faces in tense scenes. That movie was divisive among “Star Trek” fans, many of whom yelled at each other over whether it was actually “Trek” or not.', 'The newest iteration of TV “Star Trek” will engender those same discussions. But it has enough fan service to keep fans tuned in. Did I mention Sarek, Spock’s father, is here? A first officer is referred to as “Number one!” References to Kahless!', '“Discovery” has the best opening credit sequence of any of the series. True, it doesn’t have anyone narrating that space is the final frontier. However, the theme song has the familiar pings from the original series opener before it seamlessly transitions into faster paced strings that evoke the score from the Bourne franchise, eventually crescendoing into a familiar “Trek” riff that has become ingrained in pop culture. Its overlaid with gorgeous animations like those of “Westworld” or “Game of Thrones.”', 'Given the budget and advances in CGI, this is clearly the most visually stunning “Star Trek” pilot. It’s almost to the franchise’s detriment that the show is confined to being set before the original series, which, for obvious reasons, looks clunky in comparison. “Discovery” is going to have to get creative in showing off its cinematography while staying true to the timeline.', '(On that note: What’s with the hologram technology? When Sarek is talking to his adopted daughter, Michael, remotely, is he walking around where he is and sitting on a desk at his location that happens to line up with Michael’s desk? Similarly, when Admiral Anderson (Terry Serpico) is dialed in remotely talking to Philippa, he turns his head to make a biting remark to Michael standing behind him. Did he turn his head where he was transmitting from? Is he sitting in his office randomly turning his head to no one in particular?

Ms. Yeoh’s Philippa is vulnerable, capable, caring and loyal. Mr. Jones’s Saru plays a different — and seemingly more frustrated — fish out of water than Spock or Data. And his ominous delivery of the most quotable line of the episode — “My people were biologically determined for one purpose alone: To sense the coming of death. I sense it coming now.” — was flawless.', 'I’ll admit: Michael’s mutiny brought me up from my sofa. It was a truly surprising moment. But it puts Michael’s character in a big hole. She has been under Philippa’s command for seven years. Philippa seems to value her role as mentor to Michael, even to the point of saying that she believes that Michael should get her own command.', 'There isn’t much evidence that Michael would ever attack her superior officer irrationally for not attacking a Klingon ship — let alone a mentor.', '(The episode’s title is “The Vulcan Hello.” Michael describes this as how the Vulcans came to find peace with the Klingons, by pre-emptively attacking their ships, a plot point I am skeptical of, and one Michael was unconvincing in conveying.)', 'And how is the audience to view any of Michael’s future actions? To already put the viewer’s trust in the main character on shaky footing was a risky move. Kudos to the creative team for taking the leap. We’ll see if it pays off.', 'We don’t see the Discovery. Not even a glimpse of the ship that is the namesake of the show. This is another departure from previous Treks. For any fan, it’s an exciting prospect to — ahem — discover the newest “Star Trek” ship. I understand the show is serialized now, but tease us at least!', 'In previous “Trek” series, even when Klingons are talking with each other, they mostly — for the viewer’s benefit — dialogue in English. It was a contrivance (Why did Klingons often know English and Klingon, while humans knew only one of the two?) but a necessary one. In “The Vulcan Hello,” the writers made the decision to fix that hole and show the Klingons talking exclusively in their language with subtitles. It interrupts the pacing of the show when the scenes drag as long as they do, especially as you have to scrutinize subtitles for long periods of time.', '1. Early in the episode, the crew of the Shenzou are sent to the edge of Federation space to find out what happened with a relay. An object appears. Philippa asks Saru: “What am I looking at?” Saru responds, “An object of unknown origin.” Philippa snaps back: “Let’s get more specific.” In the “Voyager” pilot, after the ship is hit with an energy wave, Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) says to Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), “Captain, there’s something out there.” Janeway responds, “I need a better description than that, Mr. Kim.”', '2.

That isn’t the kiss of death for a series, but it makes it tricky to predict where audiences are going to find themselves a few episodes in, because even if you love the pilot, that’s apparently no predictor of showing up for episode three.', 'The show kicks off by throwing us into a world very similar to that of Logan. It’s an X-Men world, but after the X-Men have lost the battle with authorities, and may or may not be gone altogether. Reed Strucker (Stephen Moyer) is a prosecutor who focuses mostly on convicting mutants of largely made up crimes and getting them off the street. That may not be the official synopsis view of his role, but it’s accurate. Reed’s son, Andy (Percy Hynes White) is bullied at school, and when he decides to go to a dance, his own mutant powers are revealed when the bullies take things a little too far. When Reed’s daughter, Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind), helps her brother escape, we find out that she’s also a mutant, and has known she is for quite some time.', 'It doesn’t take long for the authorities to be on their tail, and now Reed is in a troubling position, hoping to make it on the run from the system he used to be in charge of, with his wife, Kate (Amy Acker), and kids in tow.', 'Meanwhile, a mutant has escaped from a prison and is aided by an underground group of mutants who are trying to survive in hiding. The rescue results in one of the members of the team being captured, which leads to Reed getting a chance to interrogate her.', 'With few options once he’s on the run himself, Reed contacts the mutant underground looking for help.', 'The pilot plays out more like a film than a series lead (or like condensing the first few episodes of one of the Netflix series like Daredevil or Jessica Jones), and that’s both positive and negative. Though there are some drawbacks to the initial effort, such as the shortcut spin on a bullying line that’s rather boring, the overall result is a fun thrill that looks like something with a bigger budget than it could possibly have. On the other hand, this is an origin that doesn’t leave us anywhere solid, meaning the following episodes might go anywhere at all. Is the show going to just constantly watch this family run like a 20-hour version of Logan, or is the mutant underground going to settle into something that finds us saving a wide variety of mutants episodically like some super A-Team with near-infinite guest stars? There’s no way to tell, and any guess is as good as any other.', 'One of the best points of the pilot is that Matt Nix (Burn Notice) is at the writing helm. While that strength may only have a chance to show itself so much during the pilot, Nix knows how to work characters, keep things moving without overplaying the theatrics of getting from point A to point B, and he writes great dialog. The show is already fighting an uphill battle against turning so stagy that it’s self-mocking just by virtue of the premise it has to introduce, and it manages to get a stranglehold on you right from the beginning. Like Logan, we’re putting forward a story that happens to have mutants in it, instead of something that buries you in genre mandates.', 'The combination of efforts, coupled with the lack of true entry to the future, means that it’s hard to rate the show as a series. The pilot as a standalone entity is probably a 10, but rating the series is guesswork. Moyer and Acker bring in all the charm of their past genre titles, and so far their kids are impressive. The mutants don’t get enough time to judge them in terms of being able to carry more of the effort, but who knows if they’ll need to?', 'The pilot’s only drawbacks are establishment standards. We need the Sentinel Services people to be the bad guys, but we’ll also see them a lot and need to connect to the position Reed now finds himself in. How do we do that in 45 seconds or less?

In telling a tale of real-life heroism against staggering odds, this is a rousing war picture, meant to stir equal amounts of excitement and patriotism. Set soon after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, “12 Strong” is packed with protracted battle sequences, full of deafening bombings and seemingly endless amounts of gunfire. The cumulative effect is draining; you’ll walk out of the theater with the feeling that you, too, have gone to war – and an appreciation for those who are brave enough to do so themselves.', 'But Danish commercial director Nicolai Fuglsig, making his feature filmmaking debut, draws on his previous experience as a photojournalist to bring a sense of gritty realism to the action rather than sweeping sentimentality. The vibrant sound design also plays a crucial role in immersing us, as does a score that increasingly cranks up the tension.', 'It’s all solid from a technical perspective. Where the film could have used more power is in its narrative momentum. Based on the screenplay from Ted Tally (“The Silence of the Lambs”) and Peter Craig (“The Town”)—itself inspired by Doug Stanton’s book “Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of U.S. Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in Afghanistan”—“12 Strong” eventually feels overlong and repetitive.

Mitch Nelson, the head of a dozen Green Berets who were the first American troops to set foot in Afghanistan after 9/11. Among his men are the older and more experienced chief warrant officer, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon); wisecracking Sam Diller (Michael Pena); and weapons expert Ben Milo (“Moonlight” star Trevante Rhodes). Their orders come from the no-nonsense Col. Mulholland (William Fichtner) and the thoroughly unamused Lt. Col. Bowers (comedian Rob Riggle, a Marine Corps veteran himself in a rare dramatic role).', 'Their mission is to enter northern Afghanistan through Uzbekistan with the help of the Uzbek warlord General Dostum (Navid Negahban), who has his own reasons for taking on the Taliban. Together with Dostum and his men, Nelson and his team must capture the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, a Taliban stronghold. But despite their extensive training and boundless bravery, the American troops don’t realize they’re going to have to navigate this unforgiving terrain—which notoriously has destroyed empires for centuries—on horseback. And they’ll have to do it before the winter freeze comes in three weeks.', 'It’s an amazing story but also an absurd sight: muscular soldiers strapped with high-tech gear and weaponry, galloping along on horses, facing down massive tanks and rocket launchers. Fuglsig depicts these showdowns in relentless, unflinching fashion. He’s methodical but he finds room for swagger, especially when it comes to Hemsworth’s character.', 'One of the more compelling dynamics here is the way everyone underestimates Nelson, which isn’t what you’d ordinarily expect in a character the hunky Hemsworth plays. Here, he’s too pretty, too young. He has too little field experience and constantly has to prove himself. And this is especially true within the ever-evolving relationship between Nelson and the mystically wise Dostum. Negahban is formidable but he brings a much-needed calm to the tense proceedings.', 'Naturally, Hemsworth is up to the physical demands of the role—he is Thor, after all—but he never gets enough credit for his acting chops, both dramatic and comedic. He also has a nice buddy chemistry with both Shannon and Pena. But except for a sweet subplot involving Rhodes’ character, the remainder of the team barely registers.

And understandably so: The series is a spinoff of “The Avengers,” a movie that took in $1.5 billion worldwide last year, selling roughly 78 million tickets in North America alone. If 28 percent of those ticket buyers tune in for the first episode, “S.H.I.E.L.D.” will rank as the highest-rated new drama in a decade — which would be a huge win for ABC, which is in need of fresh hits.', 'But television shows, unlike movies, prove themselves not on their marketing-amplified arrivals but week after Nielsen-scrutinized week. And Marvel, which has never made a live-action series before, faces breathtaking challenges by that measure.', 'About 75 percent of new programs on the broadcast networks fail to make it past a single season, killed by competition from the Web and cable (and sometimes by plain old bad writing). Marvel and ABC are trying to pull off the hardest trick in television: marrying two mismatched audiences. Marvel has a largely male fan base; ABC is the female-focused land of “Dancing With the Stars” and the soapy “Scandal.”', '“To succeed,” said Jeph Loeb, Marvel’s top TV executive, “we’ve got to tell stories that appeal not just to what we affectionately refer to as the Marvel zombies, but to a broader audience affectionately referred to at ABC as the ‘Scandal’ women.”', 'To achieve that ambitious goal — the safe strategy would be to pick one audience or the other — Marvel and ABC started with a direct-to-DVD short film called “Item 47.” Or, rather, Robert A. Iger did.', 'Last year, Mr. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, which owns both Marvel and ABC, watched “Item 47” and spotted the ingredients of a TV show. (It’s rare for a chief executive, even in Hollywood, to involve himself in a fledgling series, but Mr. Iger did start his career at ABC in 1974, ultimately becoming its chairman.) In “Item 47,” which was released on “The Avengers” DVD, two ordinary citizens discover a weapon left behind by aliens; S.H.I.E.L.D., which stands for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, steps in and saves the day.', 'With its intimate feel, the short film “personified what a Marvel live-action television show could be,” said Alan Fine, president of Marvel Entertainment. Joss Whedon, who directed “The Avengers” and has a TV resume that includes “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the less-successful “Dollhouse,” agreed to help create a series and direct the pilot episode.', 'S.H.I.E.L.D. was invented by Marvel comic book writers in the 1960s and updated as a movie story line in 2008, when Agent Phil Coulson popped up briefly in “Iron Man.” Coulson, a goofy bureaucrat played by Clark Gregg, reappeared in movies like “Thor” and provided a crucial plot point in “The Avengers”: He died, motivating Iron Man, the Hulk and their pals to put aside their differences and fight as one.', 'Mr. Gregg, who became a fan favorite, returns from the dead in the new TV series. (How did Coulson survive? Producers say the explanation will come as the series unfolds.) In Mr. Gregg, ABC saw not only a talented actor but a comforting and familiar face. The hope is that female viewers in particular will remember him from his stint on the comedy “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” which ran on CBS from 2006 to 2010.', 'Familiarity also factored into the casting of Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, a martial arts expert and pilot; Ms. Wen is still remembered from “ER.” But Mr. Loeb said that she was also hired to send a subtle signal to ABC’s audience.', '“We were not afraid to hire an actress who is a little older than people might expect,” Mr. Loeb said of Ms. Wen, 49. “We wanted to say something with this role: Age doesn’t matter if you’re great at what you do.” The average ABC prime-time viewer is 53.4 years old, according to Nielsen data. (Mr. Gregg is 51.)', 'Mr. Loeb and his creative team made sure they also served up a piece of man candy, casting the buff newcomer Brett Dalton as a young agent. But the most important character — after Coulson, of course — is a woman, a young computer hacker named Skye (Chloe Bennet), who is new to the organization and thus able to serve as an audience proxy. “What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for?” she asks in the pilot episode.', 'Romance was another crucial ingredient. “Our long-running shows all boast complicated characters who are engaged in dynamic and rich relationships — both romantic and platonic — and ‘S.H.I.E.L.D.’ needs to do the same thing,” said Channing Dungey, ABC’s executive vice president for drama development. So there is a simmering chemistry between Skye and Mr. Dalton’s character, and the pilot episode suggests that Coulson and Melinda May have a past.', '“Their biggest note after we presented the thing was they wanted to make sure that our investment in the characters and their interaction and their evolution was as big as the case of the week,” Mr. Whedon said of ABC.', '“Relatability” is a term that ABC and Marvel executives use frequently in discussing the series. A broad array of viewers — those “Dancing With the Stars” grandparents and “Scandal” moms — must be able to connect with the supernatural stories. “People go to movies to escape,” Mr. Loeb said. “People watch television to be a part of something.”', 'It helps that many of Marvel’s stories are set in the human world; that city in “The Avengers” might look futuristic, but it’s still New York, not Gotham. Maurissa Tancharoen, an executive producer of the series and one of four women on its eight-person writing team, said the show would include additional touches that ground the stories even more deeply in reality. For instance, part of the first episode was filmed in Paris.', '“We want it to look like the real world,” Ms. Tancharoen said. “We don’t want people to feel like they’re watching a sci-fi show.”', 'The series drew a time slot (Tuesdays at 8 p.m., Eastern and Pacific time) that in 2010 went to another new ABC superhero show, “No Ordinary Family.” That series did not come with a built-in fan base, but it failed in part because ABC was insistent on turning it into a draw for women rather than trying to expand the network’s reach by going after men.', 'Paul Lee, who took over as president of ABC Entertainment after “No Ordinary Family” was already on the schedule, is keen to avoid that trap. So he has also encouraged the writers not to skimp on fanboy treats. For instance, Coulson jokes about having been “shanked by the Asgardian Mussolini,” a reference to Loki, an evil Thor sibling who stabbed the agent in “The Avengers.”', 'The writing team has been told that certain Marvel superheroes are off limits — don’t expect Spider-Man, at work in a movie series for Sony, to show up anytime soon. But reams of lesser-known Marvel lore is at their disposal. To make sure that Marvel DNA is transported intact to television screens, the writers interact with a committee that includes creative executives from Marvel’s publishing and movie branches.', '“We send our story ideas up to them and ask if they interfere with anything they want to do in the cinematic universe,” said Joss Whedon’s brother, Jed Whedon, who is also an executive producer of the series. (To make it even more of a family affair, Jed Whedon is married to Ms. Tancharoen.)', 'Marvel and ABC also appear to be spending lavishly, at least initially, on visual effects to bridge the gap between the cinematic splendor of “The Avengers” and the small screen. The first episode cost roughly $12 million to make, a princely sum for a pilot. But shooting in Paris doesn’t come cheap and neither does a flying convertible, Coulson’s preferred method of travel.', '“The next episode will be us stuck in an elevator, because they spent all the money,” Mr. Gregg said in July at a gathering of television critics.', 'As if the series weren’t ambitious enough, Marvel is also trying to turn back time when it comes to viewer habits and network promotion. Some network pilots are now posted online ahead of their television debuts to whet interest, but Marvel has gone to extreme lengths to keep its pilot under wraps. “As opposed to something that is shared in advance and reshared and spoiled and then unrevealed,” Mr. Loeb said, “wouldn’t it be great if everybody just got together on Tuesday nights and watched?”', 'Despite all the care put into “S.H.I.E.L.D.” by multiple cooks, many questions remain. For instance, how much cross promotion will there be between the show and Marvel movies like “Thor: The Dark World,” which arrives on Nov. 8?', 'To what degree will Mr. Whedon, who is directing an “Avengers” sequel, continue to be involved with the series? “As much as an executive producer can who is also making a movie,” he said. (Translation: He will contribute writing and management, but how much has yet to be seen.)', 'Will “S.H.I.E.L.D.,” an ambitious swing by ABC at a time when broadcast television urgently needs a breakout hit, live up to the hype?', ""A version of this article appears in print on September 8, 2013, on Page AR108 of the New York edition with the headline: For Marvel, a Tricky Gene Transfer.

action "['Uneven. Epic. Mind-blowing. Mind-numbingly bad. Conflicting descriptors, for certain, but also applicable to the front half of Arrow’s inaugural season. Some would argue that the ratings speak for themselves. Arrow is one of the CW’s strongest performers. Others would say that it’s a pale imitation of its previous incarnations and wonder where Justin Hartley is. Then, there are those in the middle, like myself, who have seen glimpses of brilliance and believe that the moments where the show falters are simply the program attempting to find its sea legs.', 'Having gone back and re-watched certain episodes, I wondered if my perception would change. Here’s where I find myself:', 'For the most part, the writing for Arrow is strong. It’s structured appropriately, generally well-paced. There were a few episodes (such as “An Innocent Man”) where I felt the show was slightly off-balance or missing a plot beat that would have helped the story flow better, but the writing is solid. Is it going to be winning an Emmy anytime soon? Probably not. But, it’s got punchy dialogue, good rhythm and makes for an enjoyable hour of television (usually)', 'Here is where the show tends to lose its footing: There are two levels of writing – the technical story (aka the boring structure stuff I keep harping on) and the actual storytelling. Something can hit every single expected plot beat and not resonate because the story isn’t compelling. By the same standard, a story can be so compelling that it completely ignores typical formatting. I’ll reference Twilight (the novel) for example. It runs long, it meanders, the plot beats fall about fifty pages outside of where they should be – and it’s one of the more popular books of the century. Why? Because there is something within that babbling mess that readers relate to. Perhaps it’s the feeling of falling in love for the first time, the mystery, the … overuse of the word chagrin. Whatever the case, it inspired millions of people to pick up their eReader of choice, spawned five movies and even got its own line of limited edition cups at Burger King.', 'My point? I have one, I promise. This is where Arrow has yet to forge a unique identity for itself. The front half of the season is like shampooing your hair. Rinse. Lather. Repeat. The show seldom breaks from the, “Someone evil does something evil, Oliver puts on a hood and saves the day” routine. Said Ceena on our forums:', 'The villain of the week must stop. There is little time to properly develop them in a way that would make me care one way or another. They are just pesky little obstacles Oliver runs Arrows through to while away the hour. There is never a doubt he’ll come out on top. That is why the fight with the dark archer was such a welcome surprise.', 'In the back half of the season, I hope we see more menacing opponents for Oliver. Perhaps the focus should shift to Malcolm, who has proven to be his most deadly post-Island adversary yet. Added bonus? Tommy/Oliver drama that *gasp* has nothing to do with the world’s most lopsided love triangle. As much as I fangirl Tommy and prefer the teeny-tiny Laurel/Tommy side of that triangle (“I will go down with this ship” ain’t just Dido lyrics, people!), I would much prefer the drama to be more organic. And, what is more dramatic than finding out not only is the vigilante your girl’s lusting after your best friend, but that your dad and he are at odds because your dad’s a creepy criminal?', 'But, that would require actually using the character of Tommy for something other than being a doormat.', 'Laurel is rendered useless by large due to the Tommy/Laurel pairing they insists on having her in. She doesn’t do much besides hold his hand. I have idea why I should invest in this pairing when it is a known fact that she and Oliver are far from over and/or Tommy is going to turn into a bad guy', 'I don’t 100% agree with this statement, but I do agree that Laurel is pretty much useless. We all know where Laurel is headed. Why aren’t we getting there? I’m not saying that 14 episodes in we should see her decked out in full-on Black Canary gear, but we should at least be hearing a few cheeps. Said Pooki on our forums:', 'Laurel has done nothing but drive a love pairings between Hood/Laurel Laurel/Oliver and Tommy/Laurel. Her relationship with her father revolves around his extreme dislike of Oliver and the Hood', 'And, this is where I am. When I first signed on to do reviews, Katie Cassidy was my main draw to Arrow. She has been grossly underused and I am frustrated, both as a Katie Cassidy fan and as a fan of the show.', 'Perhaps the only thing worse than being underused is being a flip-flopper. I’ve made no secret of my rocky relationship with Thea. I started out hating her, warmed up and finally got to a place of “WTF?” Seems I’m not the only one. MaryAnn on the forums wrote:', 'I want to just say please, please give Thea a personality and stick with it. That bothers me more than the half assed character developments. And there are plenty to go around', 'I agree with this. We’ve seen Thea the backbone of the Queen family. We’ve seen Thea the self-centered brat. We’ve seen Thea the self-destructive wild child. I would like them to pick a Thea and stick with her. One cannot be both the sweet kid keeping her family together and the hellion ripping them apart.', 'Characterization is the key to longevity for a series. Would Bella ever decide, “You know, I don’t want to be a vampire. Think I’d rather go to college, maybe get some goals. I could be a doctor…except, maybe I’m too clumsy. It’s an awful affliction, you know. Akin to polio. Maybe I could be a lawyer. Or, a teacher. Or, a circus performer! But, I don’t think I want to sparkle in the sunlight. Deuces, Edward!”? No. That’s not who she is. And, while it’s a perfectly legit argument that Bella is an awful character, she’s at least a consistent character.', 'Arrow needs this. Above all else, it needs characters that the viewers can relate to and get attached to. Which brings me to my final part of this season-so-far-overview…', 'There have to be stakes. In trying to figure out why it is that I’m not rabid over this show like I am Vampire Diaries, I’ve realized it’s because there aren’t any stakes. We need a big death to shake things up. We need to know no one is safe. We need a reason to believe that these are truly life-and-death situations. I’m not advocating killing someone off just for the heck of it, but we need something that says, “This is not a safe universe. Be prepared.”', 'But, by the same token, if we don’t care about the characters, will we care if they start dropping like flies?', 'This is something to keep in mind as we move into the back half of the season. Amell’s abs might carry us to syndication, but will they make Arrow the next Buffy, a show that’s still alive and well in the fans’ hearts a decade after it went off the air?', 'Your reviews would be a lot better if you could remove the KC fan googles and see her for what she really  is, a not so good actress and is miscast. Sorry her talent is below the level of this show, she is the weakest link in the cast.', 'She is underused because she has not earned her screentime. She has been atrocious and cringe worthy in just about every scene when they did try to give her somethingto do, they have given her more than they give Colin D, Willa. She fails to impress and the writers just dont feel like writing for her or reduce her time to make the show more bearable.', 'I believe that the writers have done a great job with Thea. She is trying to find her role in the family. Imagine that stress, it could cause some conflicting characters. For a while there she was the only child left the single heir, the one who will one day run the company. That was all just dropped on her when all she wanted to do was morn her father. That causes someone to look for a reliever and that is where the partying side came in, she realizes that it isn’t the right thing to do and I feel she is trying to change but keeps getting sucked back into her bad ways of the past. That is what you have to keep in mind when looking at her character, she is finding herself in the midst of chaos.', 'I winced a little when I got to the Twilight reference.

However, if you think about it, the arrival of “Bright” makes perfect sense. Netflix has always wanted to compete with the big dogs at the studio, and you can’t name a major studio that doesn’t have an overdone, stupid blockbuster or two on their resume every year. Now Netflix has one too!', 'It’s tempting to say that “Bright” is a reboot of ""Alien Nation,"" or a modern\xa0hybrid of “District 9,” “The Lord of the Rings,” and “End of Watch” (a much-better film\xa0also helmed by this film’s David Ayer), but that might give the impression it contains a fraction of the quality of those films. No, what “Bright” reminded me of most of all was the glut of bad buddy cop movies that came out in the wake of the success of “Lethal Weapon,” star projects designed to make a quick buck on marquee names but with almost no artistic quality whatsoever. And many of them had similarly out-there concepts. I’m thinking of films like ""Red Heat"" or\xa0“Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot”. Yes, this movie reminded me of Estelle Getty.   ', ""Written by Max Landis, “Bright” imagines a world in which fantasy creatures like elves and orcs live alongside human beings. If you’re thinking, “oh, no, this means we’re going to get a lot of really basic lessons about understanding other races through a genre lens,” you’re not wrong! It’s mere minutes before Will Smith’s Officer Ward says “Fairy lives don’t matter,” and we’re treated repeatedly to paper-thin parallels between this world and our own. You see, Officer Ward has a partner that nobody likes named Jacoby (Joel Edgerton, easily the best thing about this movie). Why don’t they like him? He’s an orc, and they don’t trust that he won’t side with his people over his profession. In fact, everyone is convinced he recently did so after an orc shot Ward and escaped while Jacoby was chasing him. Over and over again, Landis treats us to a truly vague commentary on\xa0racism through the lens of “orc-ism.” And to give you an idea of how muddied and unclear this allegory is, Ward asks Jacoby “Are you a cop first or an orc first,” as we’re watching cops beat orcs in the street. Huh? Does he have to be a bad cop first? I don’t get it. And I don’t think that the movie does either, other than to show that there's something that looks like a centaur cop involved in the beating. Neat.\xa0"", 'On one long night in this magical land (Ayer loves his one-night movies), Ward and Jacoby stumble upon a magic wand because, well, why not?\xa0As you might imagine,\xa0wands are powerful currency in this world as\xa0they can make the impossible possible. They’re kind of the “one ring” of “Bright.” But only a “bright”—yes, the name actually refers to something in the film, not just how clever the filmmakers think their concept is—can hold a wand without exploding. Still, everyone wants the wand, and so Jacoby, Ward, and a new friend named Tikka (Lucy Fry),\xa0who is basically the result of Landis saying “How can we get a character like Milla Jovovich’s from “The Fifth Element” into this movie,” have to fend off corrupt cops, the feds (including a wasted Edgar Ramirez), and a powerful group of elves who lost the wand in the first place, led by an evil Noomi Rapace.   ', 'Smith, Edgerton, Rapace—it’s a decent crew, and the concept could have been developed into something intriguing if Landis wasn’t so in love with it that he forgot to write decent dialogue. The banter here is insanely sophomoric, caught between Ayer’s “realistic cop movie” aesthetic and the comic book movie that Landis wanted to make. Nonsense lines like “If you act like my enemy … you become my enemy,” will merely have you scratching your head and wondering if anyone read the script before they approved the budget or if they just so adored the concept\xa0that they didn’t care. Clearly, this is the kind of exaggerated nonsense—“this is a nuclear weapon that grants wishes” and ""that\'s when the triple stupid shit is gonna start""\xa0being two more primo bits of stuff that only work if you\'re high—that could have been effective with a director like Robert Rodriguez to inject it with enough style to make it tolerable. The fatal flaw really is that\xa0Ayer and Landis don’t seem to be making the same movie, although I’m not sure too many people could make the fantasy world of this flick and the action/buddy-cop movie blend. It’s an absolute mess.   ', 'It all culminates in an extended scene that’s basically the interrogation/torture scene out of those ‘80s and ‘90s buddy action movies only this time people are screaming “Where is the wand” over and over again for what honestly feels like eternity. It’s a scene that stands with the worst of the year in terms of structure and screenwriting, and it’s where any hope that “Bright” might bring its bizarre elements together faded completely for me. I started to think of the worst summer blockbusters of 2017 like “Transformers: The Last Knight,” “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,” and “The Mummy,” and I realized how easily this ridiculous waste of money fit in with those crowd-displeasers.

A fellow reviewer and I were discussing the timing given by the IMDb and we both thought, no way can this probably relatively dinky cops-and-robbers picture be almost two and a half hours. But it is.', '“Den of Thieves” opens with some text explaining just how many bank robberies occur in Los Angeles California over the span of one year—broken down by months, days, hours, and minutes. Having rolled out the stats, and they are impressive, the text concludes that “Los Angeles in the bank robbery capital of the world.” Already one feels the movie, co-written and directed by Christian Gudegast, is doing some kind of special pleading. There are four million stories in this naked city, and not all of them can be “Heat,” but this one is KINDA like that, okay?', 'Indeed, the movie begins with crime that’s committed like a paramilitary operation. An armored car stops at a donut place and an SUV full of masked men armed to the teeth swoop in on it. A dropped coffee sets off a trigger-happy heist man, and a near-massacre ensues. This crew didn’t want it that way, but as its mastermind, Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) glumly notes when they’ve gotten to safety, “Now we’re cop-killers.” And they did it all for an empty truck.\xa0', 'That’s one of the things that Gerard Butler’s “Big” Nick Davis, the major crimes cop on the scene, has to figure out. He runs a half-rogue crew he calls “The Regulators,” and they’re not above kidnapping and torturing suspected perps to get their men. Butler, sporting a slightly unruly beard, plays the role as if he’s imitating Mel Gibson during his drunk driving arrest. He’s crude, boorish, and cavalier. Genre mavens will see where Gudegast, who wrote Butler’s last film, “London Has Fallen” and is making his feature directorial debut here, is pulling his threads from. The Neal/Vincent dynamic of “Heat” isn’t duplicated here; it’s more like the Chance/Masters dynamic in “To Live And Die In L.A.,” in which cop and criminal dealt in the same kind of corruption but the criminal was ultimately the more ethically pure of the two. Thing is, though, “Den of Thieves” never really gets that deep, and turns out not to be all that terribly serious a movie anyway. The various character dynamics are almost a smokescreen for a convoluted heist targeting the only bank in Los Angeles that has never been robbed: the branch of the Federal Reserve where, among other things, old money is destroyed around the same time as the serial numbers attached to it are erased.\xa0', 'The plot thickens ...\xa0and thickens ...\xa0and thickens. Gudegast is clearly an avid student of heist pictures, and he layers this one with a lot of spectacular complications even while he muddles the average viewer’s potential rooting interest. As charismatic as Schreiber’s gangleader and the criminal lieutenant played by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson can be (Gudegast engineers a scene involving Jackson’s character’s daughter going on a prom date for a comic-relief “dad gives the date a talking to” scene), they’re still guys who blew away almost a dozen cops in the opening scene, so the suspense when they’re finally inside the Fed building and almost pulling things off is potentially slightly compromised. As for Butler’s Nick, yeah, he’s consistently asking for a spanking to say the least. But where Gudegast really shows his hand, if you’re in the mood to stay ahead of this movie, is in the casting. There’s one character, played by an actor of star-quality charisma, who keeps getting put off to the side in the story, and you have to wonder why. Once you’ve decided why, you can figure out at least one of the twists. And of course, the actor, who I won’t name, is winning enough that you suddenly understand exactly where your rooting interest was supposed to have been all along.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

action "['Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist), Earthling name Kara Danvers, comes from the same planet as her cousin Superman. But her personal kryptonite is her tendency to apologize for herself.', 'Early in “Supergirl,” which begins Monday on CBS, we find Kara not leaping tall buildings but saying “Sorry! Sorry!” to a guy she bumps into on the street. She has superpowers, but she’s chosen to hide them: “I decided the best thing I could do was fit in,” she says. Even her domineering boss, the media mogul Cat Grant (Calista Flockhart), criticizes her meek-mannered nature at the office. “If you can’t take credit when you do something well,” Cat says, “you’re going to be at the bottom of the pile forever.”', 'Fortunately, in her second job, Kara can fly. The zippy-as-a-speeding-bullet pilot of “Supergirl” had the built-in challenge of making its heroine more than Superman’s female brand extension. But the co-writers Ali Adler, Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg have smartly fit Supergirl’s origin story to a very current feminist theme: that women must overcome being socialized to say sorry, to put themselves second, to efface themselves. It’s a superhero story whose motto could be “Up, up and lean in!”', 'Like her supercousin (whom we see in brief glimpses), Kara is express-mailed as a child from an about-to-explode Krypton. Unlike him, she takes a time-warp detour and arrives on Earth after he has grown and become famous. Put in care of a human family, she grows up and moves to National City (like Metropolis, but with palm trees) with her foster sister Alex (Chyler Leigh), who encourages her to keep a low profile.', 'But when Kara finds herself the only one able to stop a passenger jet from crashing, she accepts her powers and discovers that she likes the family business. Like Clark Kent, though, Kara still has a day job to hold down, and colleagues to guard her secret from, including Jimmy — sorry, James — Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), recently hired from The Daily Planet.', '“Supergirl” comes amid a mini-renaissance of TV superheroines — ABC’s “Agent Carter,” Netflix’s coming “Jessica Jones” — but Hollywood’s spotty record still looms. A recent attempt to reboot “Wonder Woman” for TV fizzled, and tent-pole movies have tended to marginalize what few superheroines they have. (Last season, “Saturday Night Live” scathingly imagined Marvel casting Black Widow of “The Avengers” in a sappy rom-com.)', 'Kara’s unveiling in “Supergirl” plays as a meta-comment on these potential pitfalls. Designing an outfit with the confidant Winn (Jeremy Jordan), she rejects a Lynda Carter-esque get-up complete with hot pants. And she’s chagrined with the diminutive name that Cat uses to christen National City’s new savior in the media.', '“I’m a girl,” Cat shoots back. “And your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart. So if you perceive ‘Supergirl’ as anything less than excellent, isn’t the real problem you?” The defensiveness is blatant, but it’s a genius provocation to give the argument to Ms. Flockhart, who on “Ally McBeal” in the ’90s weathered criticism that her lawyer character — with her miniskirts and visions of dancing babies — was a bad feminist.', 'Judging from the first episode, the “girl” in “Supergirl” doesn’t diminish the character so much as define the story, a coming-of-age tale of someone embracing her nature, which happens to involve a cape and heat vision. It’s upbeat, like “The Flash” on CW. Ms. Benoist gives her character’s coming-out an infectious joy reminiscent of a recent Netflix comedy: She’s Unbreakable Kara Zor-El.', '“Supergirl” is an average action show thus far, but its star is engaging. Kara’s first mission, saving a burning jet about to crash, is the pilot’s visual showpiece, but the most striking image is the glimpse you get of Ms. Benoist’s face as she hangs upside down bringing the plane to safety. She’s not just determined or straining — she’s exhilarated.', 'Her enemies are less exciting. The pilot pits her against a sneering escaped alien convict, a musclebound threat but a dramatic zero. “Supergirl” needs an adversary with the kind of charisma and amoral zest Ms. Flockhart brings to Cat. That said, a twist at the end suggests that the series may soon get a villainy upgrade.', 'Superheroes are all about helping others, of course; as James says of Supergirl and her ilk, “Saving people is what they’re born to do.” But we’ve seen that a million times. The biggest pleasure of “Supergirl” is watching Kara Zor-El free herself.', ""A version of this review appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Leaping Tall Buildings and Leaning In.

Genre films such as this often don’t have critics’ screenings, which is fine, but practically every film nowadays has\xa0night screenings. Manhattan has hundreds upon hundreds of movie screens, yet not one of them was playing “Proud Mary”\xa0on Thursday. I do not believe this had anything to do with quality; “The Snowman,” which is about 50 times worse than this film, not only gave us all the clues but it also gave us early screenings at every single theater that ran it on its opening\xa0Friday.', 'By contrast, Screen Gems was going to make me work for this review, sending me on an Odyssey to rival Homer’s epic poem. The hero of this remake—let’s call him Odieseus—eventually found his Ithaca after a two-hour commute to a Jamaica, Queens movie theater. And I’ll be honest: Professionalism had nothing to do with it; I just really wanted to see this damn movie. Since the superb trailer, which played like gangbusters every time I saw it at theaters, I have been feening for Taraji P. Henson’s take on John Cassavetes’ “Gloria.” “Proud Mary” is fronted by\xa0an Oscar-nominated actress whose last film, “Hidden Figures” made an ungodly amount of money at the box office. Yet Screen Gems was hiding the movie from critics as if it were a drunk frat boy trying to crash a classy black-tie soiree.', '“Proud Mary” doesn’t deserve the lack of faith its studio has in it. In fact, it’s\xa0almost\xa0good, so close to success that its flaws truly become frustrating. Those flaws are all behind the camera, starting with the awful cinematography by Dan Laustsen. I haven’t seen a movie this obsessed with light coming through venetian blinds since 1984. The light is so distracting that it blots out Danny Glover’s entire face during his best scene. Much has been written about Hollywood’s inability to light Black skin, but considering that Laustsen also shot “Mimic” and “The Shape of Water,” I must conclude that his lighting here is a misguided stylistic choice.', 'The editing is also problematic, as action scenes (and even dramatic ones) too often end several beats too soon. The cadences are off-putting and rushed; numerous times the acting or the action was so involving that I wanted to spend more time within the scenes. Screenwriters Steve Antin, John Stuart Newman and Christian Swegal put in more drama than one might expect for a standard actioner, but the capable actors are undermined by the film’s construction. Director Babak Najafi manages to correct the pacing issue during the admittedly excellent action climax, but it’s too little, too late.', ""Whenever “Proud Mary” falters, the extremely talented Henson picks the film up and carries it on her capable shoulders like a wounded comrade. Just watching her from scene to scene is pure joy. Henson is an actress whose performances manifest themselves in her entire body. Here, she plays a tough hitwoman whose unexpected maternal instinct comes with a heaping side order of guilt. These conflicting feelings seem to emanate from her soul. Watch how she temporarily melts in the arms of a former lover before coming to her senses, or how she holds her head when she tells her orphaned young ward Danny (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) what to do in case of her demise. Or how she nonchalantly blows people away with the coolness of Schwarzenegger or Stallone. Her parental arguments with Danny are also delivered with expert comic timing and she’s savvy enough to know when to let Winston steal the scene. One senses this was a passion project of hers because she’s fully committed even when the film lets her down."", 'In addition to Winston, whose lack of precociousness is refreshing, “Proud Mary” also has good performances by Billy Brown, who plays the aforementioned love interest and Danny Glover, whose Godfather-like character marks his return to bad guy roles. The best parts of “Proud Mary” are the moments when the film investigates the complicated emotional contracts between its characters. Much of Mary’s story entails her attempts to hide betrayals from the people she cares for, especially where Danny is concerned. Danny’s father is the first hit we see Mary perform, and her guilt at leaving him parentless weighs on her conscience almost as much as the fear that Danny will figure out her connection to him. When Benny spills the beans about Mary to Danny, Glover superbly plays the moment like a more charming Bill Sykes from Oliver Twist.', '“Proud Mary” has enough going for it that one wishes for an “All the Money in the World”-style do-over: Replace the cinematographer with Ernest Dickerson, perhaps, and the editor with the folks from “Baby Driver.” Alas, that future won’t come to pass. I am giving a mild thumbs down here, but if you’re a fan of Ms. Henson, don’t let me stop you from seeing this.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Lean and ambitious, unsentimental and bombastic, overwhelmingly guy-centric, Christopher Nolan\'s World War II epic ""Dunkirk"" showcases the best and worst of the director\'s tendencies. The best win out and the worst recede in memory when you think back on the experience—provided that you want to remember ""Dunkirk,"" a movie that\'s supposed to be grueling and succeeds. Less of a war film and more of a disaster (or survival) picture, it\'s an ensemble work that chronicles the evacuation of British soldiers who got trapped in the harbor and on the beaches of Dunkirk, France, in late May and early June of 1940, with the Germans, who had driven Allied forces practically out to sea, closing in for one last sweep.', 'If you were to make a list of every phobia you can think of, you\'d have to tick off a lot of boxes after seeing this film. Fear of heights, fire, drowning, confined spaces, darkness, abandonment—you name it, it\'s represented in cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema\'s nightmarishly clear images. And if you see the movie in one of the handful of theaters showing it in 70mm IMAX format, the experience will feel even more constricting and oppressive because of the image\'s unusual shape. It\'s close to the old-fashioned ""Academy"" ratio common to films made in cinema\'s early decades: squarish, tall instead of wide. That means that when you\'re in the cockpit of a fighter\xa0 diving towards the water, or running behind an infantryman dodging German snipers, the idea of ""tunnel vision,"" a phrase spoken by many a catastrophe survivor, comes to life onscreen. ', ""The film will be shown in a wider format in most cinemas, but I doubt this will lessen the overall effect: this is a pile-driver of a movie, dropping one visual or aural bomb after another, with barely a pause to contemplate what it's just shown you. To watch it is to feel beleaguered.\xa0This was a period in which German military power was ascendant and hope for the United Kingdom's survival was starting to ebb. The story of Dunkirk has been told on film before, notably in Leslie Norman's same-titled 1958 feature, and there has been no shortage of other films about other battlefield rescues; but this one feels different, mainly because of how it's made.\xa0"", ""Nolan, who also wrote the film's script, drops you into the middle of the action from frame one and keeps you there. This is an ensemble movie that doesn't just fail to delineate most of its characters through exposition but seems to take perverse pride in letting them scamper anonymously across the screen at flyspeck distance, getting lost amid crowds or merging with smoke or water. Scenes sometimes play out for minutes without audible dialogue, a rarity in commercial cinema made at this budget level; it's even rarer in Nolan's own films, which tend to clarify narrative via massive verbal exposition dumps. Nolan and van Hoytema hold shots longer than the Nolan norm, sometimes long enough to let you consider everything in the frame and decide where to let your eye settle. "", 'Like a more restless cousin of Terrence Malick, who infused the combat picture with Transcendental philosophy in ""The Thin Red Line,"" or Robert Altman, who painted microcosmic panoramas of civilization in such films as ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts,"" ""Dunkirk"" treats every person on that beach and in assorted nearby planes and boats as part of a collective organism, less interesting for their biographical details than for the roles they play in the drama of history, however large or small they may be. ""Dunkirk""\xa0is what I like to call an Ant Farm Picture: it\'s a portrait of a society, or a species, fighting for its life. It\'s not hugely interested in the plight of individuals, unless they\'re trying to save themselves or others. If you get confused about who\'s who and what\'s what from time to time, you can rest assured that this is a feature of Nolan\'s methods, not a bug (pun intended).\xa0', 'Tom Hardy plays a fighter pilot trying to blast German pilots out of the sky before they can strafe soldiers on the ground and sink boats in the harbor. He has maybe a dozen lines and spends much of the film behind a mask, as he did in his last collaboration with Nolan, ""The Dark Knight Rises""; but he makes a strong impression anyway by treating the character as the sum total of his actions. Mark Rylance plays a civilian with teenage sons who is determined to pilot his small yacht to Dunkirk and rescue as many people as he can; there are lots of these self-appointed rescuers around Dunkirk; their ultimate organization into one of the twentieth century\'s boldest non-military flotillas is as inspiring as you imagine it to be. A trio of soldiers, one of whom is played by Harry Styles, rushes from the town to the beach and onto a long dock that stretches into the ocean; this is the only way that big boats can get close enough to shore to pick up the stranded. The would-be passengers pray that they can pile onto a ship and get out before more German planes shred them with bullets or bombs. Some of the characters, including Hardy\'s Farrier and Rylance\'s Mark Dawson or Kenneth Branagh\'s Commander Bolton, the highest ranking English officer on the scene, are given names. Others are identified only by their general appearance or actions, such as Cillian Murphy, known only as ""Shivering Soldier""; he\'s pulled from the icy sea by Rylance\'s captain and strongly urges the crew to sail away from Dunkirk, not toward it.', ""The film has its share of stumbling blocks. One is the persistent anonymity of the characters; just because a gambit is a conscious part of the film's design doesn't mean it always works, and there are moments you may wonder whether treating supporting players as something other than glorified cannon fodder might have resulted in a film as emotionally powerful as it is viscerally overwhelming. Another miscalculation is the score, by Hans Zimmer,\xa0a Jungian din of booming drums, bum-vibrating synth chords, and cawing string effects that loses much of its power by refusing to shut up, even when silence or ambient war noise might have been just as effective, or more so. The overuse of Zimmer's music has been an issue throughout Nolan's career, but here may become an object of debate. The situations and images are so vivid that the score often seems to be trying to rescue a film that doesn't need its help."", 'I was more on-the-fence about the movie\'s intricate narrative construction, but once the film\'s visceral impact had faded, it was there that my mind wandered. Like most of Nolan\'s films, ""Dunkirk"" is obsessed by the relative perception of time. This is emphasized here by the cross-cutting of Lee Smith. Smith has edited all of Nolan\'s movies since ""Batman Begins""—including ""Interstellar,"" which is explicitly about the idea of time passing more quickly or slowly depending on where you are. ""Dunkirk"" tells us in its chapter-like opening titles that one major subplot takes place over a week, another in a day, and yet another in one hour. Then the movie hops between them in ways that compress and expand time for poetic effect—making, say, a plane\'s run that probably took thirty seconds seem to take exactly as long as a sea rescue that lasted hours. ', 'One could make a case that this amounts to over-intellectualization of a strong, simple tale. But that\'s been Nolan\'s m.o. from ""Following"" and ""Memento"" onward, and I\'d be lying if I said it didn\'t fascinate me, even if a particular film isn\'t doing much for me scene-to-scene. It has often been said that trauma wreaks havoc with one\'s perceptions of time. This is one of the few works I can think of that considers that idea over the course of a whole feature, not just in self-contained sequences. (The backbone of Zimmer\'s score, appropriately, is a ticking clock.)', 'If somebody were to ask me if I liked this film, I would tell them no. I loathed parts of it and found other parts repetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired it throughout, and have been thinking about it constantly since I saw it. Even the aspects of ""Dunkirk"" that didn\'t sit right with me are all of a piece. This is a movie of vision and integrity made on an epic scale, a series of propositions dramatized with machines, bodies, seawater and fire. It deserves to be seen and argued about. They don\'t make them like this anymore. Never did, really.\xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

(Aside from Christopher Nolan\'s Batman trilogy, ""Logan,"" and a handful of other dark superhero films, excessive moping and brooding tends to be these projects’ undoing.) It’s unfortunate that the film was released on the heels of ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" another knockabout superhero adventure, because critically it will suffer in comparison, even though it chooses a different route toward a similar destination, overcoming daunting production hurdles in the process.   ', '“Justice League” never matches the latter film in visual invention, though, and it has basic script problems that never get solved. One is figuring out how to balance the screen time of known quantities from previous entries, such as Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Superman (not a spoiler; Henry Cavill’s name is on the poster, folks), against another standard-issue, roaring-and-stomping bad guy (Ciaran Hinds’ Steppenwolf, leader of the Parademons) and three major new characters: The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). The plotline that brings the heroes together is the impending invasion of earth by Steppenwolf, who wants to recover and merge three magic boxes that will give him ultimate power and terraform the planet and blah-de-blah, who cares, seriously, it doesn’t matter.', ""All that being said, this is an ensemble adventure that’s nearly as satisfying (and humble in its aims) as the “Avengers” movies. Like the recent “Thor,” it seems to have figured out that a mega-budgeted superhero picture can be serious without carrying on as if humor, sentiment, and even color are inherently childish. “Justice League” splits the difference between Snyder’s kinetic, cruelly funny “Dawn of the Dead” remake and “Sucker Punch” and his more dour, depressive epics like “300,” “Man of Steel” and “BvS.” It’s the kind of movie where The Flash can serve as wide-eyed, often bumbling comic relief, much as Spider-Man did in the second half of “Captain America: Civil War,” and Batman can bust Aquaman’s chops for bringing a “pitchfork” (actually a trident) to a battle.   But it’s also the kind of film where every member of the Justice League—plus Lois Lane and Diane Lane's Martha Kent—can have a heartfelt “spotlight” moment in which they admit withdrawing from life or putting up a tough façade to cushion the pain of loss, and rest assured that the other characters, and the film itself, will take their anguish seriously. (There are hints that Steppenwolf is working through a version of this problem: part of his grudge against Earth comes from being publicly humiliated eons ago.) "", ""The scenes of Lois and Clark’s reconciliation are brief but sensitively rendered. Almost as moving is the newfound reasonableness of Batman, a miserable loner who seems to have been shocked into sensitivity (at least as much sensitivity as Bruce Wayne is capable of) by the death of Superman, an event for which he assumes primary responsibility. There are moments where you wonder if he's trying to build a team not just to save the planet but to give himself a circle of friends and a reason to check in with them every day. The greying, thickening Affleck is endearing here because he leans into his age, playing up the character's more grievous injuries and making light of the fact that he's not the Bat he used to be.\xa0"", 'The movie starts by hauling out clichéd elements, including a bleached-out color palette, a funeral in pouring rain, and a mopey, piano-driven version of a dark pop anthem (in this case, Sigrid\'s cover of Leonard Cohen\'s ""Everybody Knows""). But the BummerVision filmmaking proves to be an aesthetic setup for a worthy payoff: ""Justice League"" adds wit, invention, color and warmth as it goes along, a strategy befitting a story about characters (and a world) waking up from emotional sleep and learning to take risks and care again. The movie wears its big themes on its sleeves, or breastplates, expressing them via on-the-nose dialogue and brazenly metaphorical images, like the climactic shots of flowers blooming in vivid color and a stirring image of two Amazon warriors, representatives of a society that bears an unimaginable burden, bracing their shoulders against a closing stone door like sisters of Atlas. But that’s what films like this do, just as Westerns and zombie movies and other genre films did before them. “Justice League” is an honorable example of how to work in that mode with skill and a poker face.\xa0 ', ""The inevitable return of Superman is powerful partly because Snyder and company established that his death plunged the world into a haze of despair, superstition, reactionary politics, and revolutionary-flavored violent crime. If the big blue marvel is, as “Batman v. Superman” suggested, something like a god, that means God is temporarily dead when our story begins (his allure smashed into pieces like that giant statue of Kal-El), and therefore can’t watch over us. God's absence means the weaker, meaner, more opportunistic mortals and immortals feel emboldened to do their worst.   These aspects of the film are so intriguing that one wishes that they’d been more fully developed, along with the allusions to rising religious fundamentalism and the straightforward equating of Steppenwolf to Satan, a creature of raw chaos and viciousness stepping into a power vacuum. (“Praise to the mother of horrors!” he roars.) But if the film is\xa0 a potluck stew of half-cooked notions, it's at least a tasty one."", ""Although Ezra Miller’s Jeff Goldblum-like incarnation of the Flash is the most shameless crowd-pleaser, Wonder Woman hooks the film into a belt loop and walks away with it. “Justice League” mishandles the Amazons to give the movie an early jolt of high stakes drama, teases the idea that Batman and Wonder Woman will become a couple (but thankfully doesn’t pursue it), and lets Wonder Woman become an unofficial mommy to the rest of the Justice League, armored men whose competitiveness and wiseguy insults make them seem like overgrown boys, but her character isn't purely reactive, and the filmmakers don't sell her out. Wonder Woman's decency, compassion and\xa0moral certitude deliver the same electric charge here that earlier\xa0generations got from watching Christopher Reeve play Superman/Clark Kent. Her goodness isn't an act. It's who she is.  "", 'It’s frustrating to see ""Justice League""\xa0fail to get out of its own way, because whenever it does, it shrugs off the burdens of its famously troubled production and becomes special. An exact accounting of what went wrong is a matter for an investigative reporter, not a film reviewer, but one would assume that the filmmaking process wasn’t helped by the studio’s sudden, post-“Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice” demand that the story add humor and camaraderie. Ditto the March, 2017 death of director Zack Snyder’s daughter, which put Joss Whedon, who’d already been hired for rewrites, in charge of post-production (including the CGI erasure of a mustache that Cavill grew after he thought the shoot had wrapped—a dubious technical triumph that results in some weird-looking close-ups). The extent of Whedon’s involvement in this rescue operation\xa0is anybody\'s guess. Regardless, the end product is coherent: funny but rarely glib, serious but unpretentious, and better than it had any right to be. \xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'There is a sequence near the end of ""True Lies"" in which Arnold Schwarzenegger is piloting a Harrier vertical-takeoff fighter plane, which hovers near a Miami high-rise while his teenage daughter clings precariously to the cockpit cover and a villain dangles by his gunbelt from one of the wingmounted missiles. Arnold arms the missile and fires it, terrorist attached, straight through the high-rise, and it shoots down a helicopter carrying other terrorists. This takes place, I might add, shortly after a nuclear bomb has vaporized one of the Florida keys.', 'It\'s stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and ""True Lies"" has a lot of it: Laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don\'t take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity. Schwarzenegger has found himself in a lot of unlikely situations in his action-packed career, and ""True Lies"" seems determined to raise the ante - to go over the top with outlandish and extravagant special effects scenes.', 'Consider, for example, a chase sequence near the beginning of the movie, in which a bad guy on a motorcycle is chased by Arnold, on a horse, through a hotel lobby. Most movies would be content with that. Not ""True Lies,"" which continues the chase on high-rise elevators and ends up on the hotel roof, with Arnold urging the horse to attempt a free fall into a swimming pool.', 'The plot is, of course, little more than a clothesline upon which to hang such set pieces. It involves Schwarzenegger as Harry, an ace U.S. spy, who has been married for 15 years to a sweet-tempered wife named Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who thinks he is a computer salesman. (He works for something called the Omega Force, which describes itself in its seal as ""The Last Line of Defense."") How he has successfully managed this deception is one of the many questions the film does not pause to answer.', 'As the film opens, Schwarzenegger and his partner Gib (Tom Arnold) are involved in a James Bondian attempt to infiltrate a rich arms dealer\'s black tie party in a Swiss chateau. To say security is tight would be an understatement; the guards have machine guns and attack dogs. At the party, Schwarzenegger meets the beautiful Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere, looking much more elegant than in ""Wayne\'s World"") and tangos with her before accomplishing his mission and surviving a bloody getaway. (Schwarzenegger\'s tangoing ability is reflected by the decision to film most of the dance as head-and-shoulders shots.) Cut back to Washington, D.C., and Schwarzenegger\'s life of uneventful domestic tranquillity (his wife thinks he was out of town at a sales convention). But then, when it appears the dealer has sold four atomic weapons to a terrorist gang, it\'s up to Schwarzenegger and the surprisingly engaging Tom Arnold to stop them.', 'In between the action packed first and third acts, however, is a curious second act in which Schwarzenegger becomes convinced that his wife is fooling around with a car salesman (Bill Paxton).', ""This leads to an elaborate charade in a hotel room, where, for reasons that are much too complicated to summarize here, Jamie Lee Curtis impersonates a hooker and Schwarzenegger impersonates her client. (We are supposed to believe she doesn't recognize her husband because he has a light behind him.) Curtis earns some laughs here, doing a quasi-striptease. The physical humor is effective, and she's charmingly sexy and klutzy."", ""But the whole scene smells fishy. If you take a step back from the movie and really think about the trick the spy is playing on his wife, it's cruel and not funny. And it sidetracks the plot. The movie is 135 minutes long, and at 120, without some of the hotel room escapade, it would be a lot better."", 'The director, James Cameron, is a master of action (he worked with Schwarzenegger on ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""), and when he\'s doing his thing, no one does it better. That includes the third act of the movie, in which a breathless Miami newscaster reports on a high-rise terrorist drama, and barely has time to squeeze in the information that an A-bomb has just blown up one of the Keys.', 'Cameron is credited with the screenplay (which is ""based on"" a French screenplay by three others), and keeps a nice undertone of humor going. When we\'re learning about one of the evil terrorists, for example, here\'s the exchange: ""They call him the Sand Spider."" ""Why?"" ""Probably because it sounds scary."" One nice surprise is Tom Arnold, who has a major role - the equal of Curtis\' - and fills it nicely. He has an everyman quality about him, and an ability to deliver an irreverent aside, which make him a good foil for Schwarzenegger. And when he gives advice on divorce and marriage, which he does frequently, he sounds as if he speaks from experience.', '""True Lies"" doesn\'t rank as high as ""Terminator 2"" and ""Total Recall"" (1990) among Schwarzenegger\'s action epics for a couple of reasons: The unconvincing interlude where the hero suspects adultery, and the perfunctory nature of the plot.

action "['A slightly earlier than normal TV review this month, to get ahead of all the Christmas telly — but there’s still plenty to discuss…', 'The Punisher \xa0Season 1\nThe fourth live-action iteration of Frank Castle, Marvel’s murderous anti-hero (and people moan about Spider-Man reboots), debuted in Daredevil season two and was greeted so positively that now he’s got his own spin-off series. And “spin-off” is not an inaccurate descriptor, because this very much launches out of the events of Frank’s storyline in Daredevil — which makes it all the more annoying that Netflix care not for “previously on”s: Daredevil season two was over 18 months ago; a little refresher would be nice.', 'You see, the plot revisits the Punisher’s origins: his family were killed in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out, leading him to kill the criminals responsible. He thinks that mission is complete, but the season begins (more or less) with him discovering new intel that suggests his family’s murder may not have been so random, and it links back to his actions when he was in the military. This also serves as a launchpad for the series to tackle other war-related issues, primarily the psychological wellbeing of veterans. With such serious themes it’s perhaps no surprise that there’s very little here that’s outright comic-book-y here — no superpowers, for sure; not even veiled references to the big names of the MCU movies, which we’ve had in every other Marvel Netflix show. In fact, if it weren’t for the fact the series is so obviously spun out of Daredevil and has the Marvel logo at the start, you could be forgiven for thinking it wasn’t a Marvel show at all.', 'Some people think this removes the Punisher’s USP. In and of himself he’s just a violent man out for revenge — action cinema is stuffed to bursting with such anti-heroes. What makes Frank unique is he’s that kind of character but in a world where super-powered and super-moral people exist. So would The Punisher have been more interesting if, instead of a very grounded military conspiracy storyline, it had something to do with Frank clashing with superpowered people? I don’t know. It certainly would’ve been a different show. As it stands, this may be a show for people who don’t typically like Marvel shows. So was Jessica Jones before it, but this is for different people who don’t like Marvel shows — people like Jason Statham, maybe.', 'In the title role, Jon Bernthal is fantastic. You can absolutely believe him as a revenge-driven psychopath capable of killing anyone and everyone, but also as a kind-of-charming strong-but-silent type with a heart and moral code who will definitely do the right thing. I’ve seen some critics and viewers opine that now is the wrong time for a series about a hero who just murders indiscriminately. I say those people definitely haven’t watched this Punisher. Although the plot is a conspiracy thriller, the series invests a lot of time in the emotional world of Frank Castle, making him human and moral rather than just a single-minded murder-machine. Bernthal makes what could be a very one-note role into a plausible human being; one who you believe might be able to find redemption and leave someday. And maybe that makes him even more tragic — he could find it; it’s possible… but likely? There’s the rub. As it’s also trying to engage with issues facing combat veterans once they return home, it makes for a clearly different, more serious flavour for an MCU production. How successfully it explores these weighty issues is more debatable.', 'Many of these Marvel shows take their whole first season to fully complete the hero’s origin story, but The Punisher is stuck with the fact that Castle already became The Punisher during his Daredevil appearance. So do they just ignore that story shape? No, of course they don’t — they shift it on to the villain! Therefore any comic book fan who knows what one character will ultimately become (no spoilers here!) is constantly teased with possibilities throughout the season until, eventually, as we should’ve known from the start, the transformation occurs in the finale. Why not really surprise us: do the transformation earlier and then wrap a character up within one season, rather than leaving them dangling for a possible next time? Comic books have to leave things dangling — they will all run for ever and ever; there can be no permanent solutions — but these TV series will end — whether it’s after a single season, or two, or five, or ten, they are without exception finite. That means you’re allowed to wrap a character up and move on to others.', 'So, The Punisher is not an unmitigated success, but it does lend another flavour to the Marvel-Netflix landscape. I certainly hope we get to see more of Bernthal’s take on the character in the future.', 'Detectorists \xa0Series 3 Episodes 2-6\nThe third and final series of BBC Four’s sitcom about a couple of mates whose hobby is metal detecting was every bit the equal of the first two runs, which saw the show place on my list of 10 Favourite TV Series of the Last 10 Years back in February. Its brilliance lies in how perfectly weighted it is: the characters are quirky, but also normal; their problems are grounded and realistic, without being glum and unduly serious; it’s frequently hilarious, but without slipping into gurning ‘Comedy’ territory; it’s kind and gentle, but without being dull; and it’s all very lovely and kind-hearted, without being twee or saccharine. It’s also beautifully put together by writer-director (and star) Mackenzie Crook — the storyline across the series was precisely constructed, and the photography is often a gorgeous showcase for the English countryside. A real gem that will be missed, though at least it came to a perfect conclusion.', 'The Good Place \xa0Season 1 Episodes 3-13\nI only heard about this after its Big Twist was much-discussed online, so starting it was an exercise in knowing there was a big reveal awaiting. Fortunately, that knowledge doesn’t overshadow everything that comes before it. For those who still aren’t aware of it (especially as it’s only on Netflix on this side of the pond), it’s about a woman (Kristen Bell) who dies and goes to Heaven only due to an admin error, so she tries to better herself so that she’s deserving of her place. Other complications emerge as the season goes on, but that’s the premise. There’s a lot of plot for a sitcom — although it’s not necessarily immediately obvious, it tells a 13-episode story; this makes Netflix quite a natural home for it, actually, as it’s not your typical “every episode is fundamentally standalone” sitcom. But it’s also very funny in amongst all that, mining not only the characters and their foibles, but also the uncommon situation they’ve found themselves in. The shocker in the finale is just the icing on the cake. I hear season two has gone off the boil somewhat, but I’ll find out for myself once it’s all wrapped up.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have been missing so much stuff. There’s been the fourth series of Peaky Blinders on BBC Two (which concludes this week, so we’ll whizz through it sometime in the new year); the season season of The Crown on Netflix (also waiting for the new year now); the same streamer’s first ever miniseries, Godless; the immensely acclaimed Blue Planet II (now available in UHD on iPlayer, too!); and I’m behind on Arrow and The Flash so haven’t reached the four-show Arrowverse crossover.

Eggsy performs this act reluctantly, we are meant to understand, in part because he is now in a committed relationship with the Swedish Princess who gifted him with anal sex in the first movie. ', '“Kingsman: The Golden Circle,” which finds the British tailors decimated and forced to join forces with a whiskey manufacturing U.S. spy network called “Statesman” and featuring such personages as Channing Tatum, Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry, is even longer than the first movie, clocking in at two hours and 20 minutes or so. As action-packed as the movie is, it feels like it’s six hours. That’s in part because the pacing is so spavined; the movie lurches twitchily from set piece to set piece and spends inordinate amounts of time on shots of its sharp-dressed characters slow-motioning into the widescreen frames showing off accessories that will be sold to you by various companies in various Kingsman tie-ins all over the Internet. (A scene wherein Firth is packing up his things finds the actor taking special care to make sure the wooden Art of Shaving soap dish is turned to the camera lens. In recent weeks, I’ve received no less than a dozen e-mails from Art of Shaving, all tied in to “Kingsman.”)\xa0', 'It also feels long because every bit or joke is dragged out long past its funniness or shock value. The plot here, just as reactionary in its way as that of the first one, centers around a drug cartel, the Golden Circle, run out of a jungle presided over by Julianne Moore’s Poppy. (I hope the producers of this movie paid Moore an inordinate amount of money, because all she gives them in return for her fee is a passable Megan Mullally impersonation, which is still less than they deserve.) Poppy’s very rich and powerful but also isolated and lonely, so she’s kidnapped Elton John and is forcing him to perform solely for her. Elton John is played by himself. This is funny at first, then sour, then gets beaten worse than a dead horse as Sir Elton is made a plot point and a climactic action sequence is played out over one of his more raucous numbers. “Enough,” one thinks, but “enough” does not exist in the philosophy of this movie.', 'Well, I suppose it does in one respect. In “Kingsman: The Secret Service,” villain Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson, inveigled various world leaders into going along with his twisted save-the-earth doomsday scheme; he then implanted a device in their necks that, unbeknownst to them, could blow up their heads if triggered. One of the world leaders was meant to be taken for then-President Barack Obama. And at the movie’s ending, all the head-exploding devices were made to go off, and the audience was invited to guffaw at the spectacle of Barack Obama’s head blowing up. This movie’s plot hinges on tainted drugs that will kill, potentially, all the world’s substance abusers. The scheme, initiated by Moore’s character, is reported by Fox News, none of whose correspondents are shown to have the sign of the taint. Because no one who works for Fox News does drugs, as we know. This movie also features a United States President, but not a real one, as the last film did; this movie’s president is white, and played by Bruce Greenwood. It’s probably just a coincidence that this movie is produced by Fox. It probably means nothing that this movie, made by people who invited you to laugh at the violent death of the United States’ first black president, won’t touch Donald Trump with a ten-foot pole. They can’t be racist, right? They cast Halle Berry in this movie and Samuel L. Jackson in the last. They approve of black actors at least. ', 'Speaking of actors, this is a movie that makes you wonder about them as a class. Can Colin Firth, Channing Tatum, Mark Strong, Jeff Bridges, Poppy Delevingne, Julianne Moore, Michael Gambon, and so many others in the cast be themselves as soul-dead and life-hating as this movie?

The good news, on the other hand, is that with the advent of VOD, audiences can go about completely ignoring it from the comfort of their own homes rather than having to venture out to the local multiplex in order to snub it. The film may be completely worthless from an artistic standpoint but it certainly can’t be beat from a convenience standpoint.', 'Set on the mean streets of Cleveland, the story begins as Roman McGregor (Ashton Holmes) is about to marry childhood sweetheart Mia (Melissa Bolona). Alas, disaster strikes when, at her bachelorette party, Mia gets into a fight with a couple of sleazes (Sean Brosnan and Rotimi), who are the chief goons for local crime lord Max Livingston (Mike Epps) and they retaliate by kidnapping her to serve as a part of their boss’s foray into human trafficking. On the bright side, Roman’s two older brothers, Deklan (Cole Hauser) and Brandon (Shawn Ashmore), are both military veterans who apparently returned from the front with a lot of leftover hardware (and plenty of issues with unchecked rage in the case of Deklan) and the three of them, convinced that the police are powerless to do anything, band together to track Mia down and kill every bad guy they come across. Although sympathetic to their cause (having already dropped another trafficker off a building during the opening action sequence), Detective James Avery (Bruce Willis) doggedly tries to counsel them against vigilantism while building a proper case against against Max, but soon finds his attitude changing when his noble efforts prove to be for naught.', 'As someone who has never shied away from the trashier meats to be found in the cinematic stew, I don’t mind “Acts of Violence” being nothing more than an overt example of exploitation filmmaking—I object to it being a cut-rate one. The basic story is so pathetically thin and simplistic that even action junkies with low standards—pretty much this film’s target audience—will find themselves thinking that maybe writer Nicolas Aaron Mezzanatto and director Brett Donowho could have made a little more of an effort in terms of pacing. As for the characters, they are so utterly unremarkable that the simple act of remembering their names as the film goes along will prove to be too much for most people, and the performances show a similar level of utter indifference.', 'However, what pushes “Acts of Violence” from the merely stupid to the decidedly unsavory is the way in which it drags in serious issues to serve as window dressing for the garbage at hand. Near the beginning of the film, for example, we see Deklan blowing up at an ineffectual VA stooge for being incapable of offering any help for his emotional problems and rage issues other than more medication. This is an issue of real concern to many people but as it turns out, the film has no use for it other than to serve as a clumsy explanation for Deklan’s abilities as a one-man killing machine. (Even more distastefully, once all the ensuing slaughter has concluded, we get a final shot of him clearly feeling a lot better, suggesting that bloodshed is the only real cure for PTSD.) Human trafficking is another important and troubling issue, but the film uses it as little more than a gimmick to justify the violence rather than to really examine it at any length. Furthermore, it is a little difficult to take seriously a story dealing with the horrors of the exploitation of women that itself takes the time for a long strip club sequence featuring an extended three-woman lap dance.', 'At the beginning of this review, I compared “Acts of Violence” to the garbage on which Charles Bronson frittered away the latter part of his career—things like “The Evil That Men Do,” “Murphy’s Law” and the lesser “Death Wish” sequels. In hindsight, perhaps that comparison isn’t fair because as bad as those movies were, Bronson at least put in some effort, which is more than one can say for Bruce Willis here. Yes, this is another one of those anonymous action movies that he has been specializing in as of late—the kind that turn up in a couple of theaters and on VOD with virtually no advance word and featuring listless performances by him that, based on the available evidence, were apparently shot in no more than four or five days, most of them utilizing the same office set. Why he would want to squander his still-considerable talent and screen presence on something as low-rent as this is beyond me—as it could not have been for the money, my only guess is that he wanted to squeeze in a few quick rounds before doing the “Death Wish” remake. At one point, in what proves to be the only remotely realistic moment on display, his character remarks “I’m tired of this”—by the time “Acts of Violence” reaches its conclusion, any still left watching it will doubtlessly feel the same way.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

There's a lot of shooting first and asking questions later -- though not everyone survives the shooting part. Expect lots of gunfights, often using automatic weapons, and some deaths. As the series has progressed, it's grown more violent, and more likely to focus on murder than other crimes. Viewers will see car accidents, scantily clad women in jeopardy, serial killers, dead bodies, violence that causes blood to splatter everywhere, and so on. There are also autopsies with bloody, gory dead bodies on a table, and graphic photos of their injuries displayed above. Beach scenes are often an excuse for the camera to leer at women in bikinis.

When he arrives, the governor (Jean Smart) offered him a job: heading up an elite new crime-fighting unit designed to bring down the worst offenders in the islands. ""Your rules,"" she promised him, ""my backing, no red tape."" In other words, McGarrett had free rein to hunt down the bad guys with no regard for standard cop procedure. He could shoot first and ask questions later. But McGarrett\'s carte blanche was cut short when the governor was murdered, and the new governor had much less patience with his freewheeling ways.

No, the question is whether the general public will be in a mood to see a movie in which the entire planet is threatened with attacks of extreme weather in the wake of all the meteorological chaos of the last few weeks. As it turns out, people who were leery of going to see it for that reason can rest easy because, despite the ad campaign to the contrary, the film is actually an utterly idiotic and oftentimes boring amalgamation of “The Day After Tomorrow,” “San Andreas,” “Gravity,” “The Manchurian Candidate” and the lesser Irwin Allen productions. “Geostorm” fails to work either as awe-inspiring spectacle or as campy silliness.', 'As the film opens, we learn that Earth was hit with a series of catastrophic extreme weather events in 2019 that wiped out entire cities. Finally recognizing the dangers of global warming (which proves that the film is a fantasy), the U.S. joins the other countries of the world to combat it by taking point in the creation of a massive satellite system, nicknamed “Dutch Boy” because why not, that tracks extreme weather systems and eliminates them before the destruction can begin. Dutch Boy is the brainchild of two-fisted, hard-drinking and inexplicably Scottish American scientist Jake Lawson (Butler) who runs the system along with an international crew up in space. However, he is one of those guys who just cares too much and when a Senate hearing goes sideways, he is fired from the project by its new head, his own brother, Max (a burr-free Jim Sturgess).\xa0', 'Three years later, the U.S. is about to cede its authority over Dutch Boy to all the countries of the world when a mishap occurs involving a malfunctioning satellite and an entire village in the theoretically sweltering Afghanistan desert is flash frozen as a result. Not wanting to turn over a flawed system, the President of the United States (Andy Garcia) opts to have Max send someone up to find out what happened and fix it and (spoiler alert) Jake ends up going up to do it. After about six minutes, Jake and\xa0the station commander (Alexandra Maria Lara) figure out that system has been sabotaged, a conclusion that Max also comes to down on Earth. While other cities are hit with insane weather—Tokyo gets hail the size of canned Okja while a bikini babe in Rio is seen trying to outrun the cold—the two brothers try to get to the bottom of what appears to be a massive conspiracy and stop it before the satellites can create a “geostorm,” an ever-expanding mass of cataclysmic weather that could kill untold millions throughout the world.', 'You know how when a big-ticket genre film comes out and within a couple of weeks, there will already be a knockoff of it featuring cut-rate special effects, an utterly insane storyline and B-level actors\xa0(if we are lucky) traipsing through the silliness in exchange for a quick paycheck? “Geostorm” feels like the first $120 million (according to the studio) version of such a film—the effects may be somewhat better than the stuff you see on the Syfy network but even the producers over there might have blanched at the nonsense offered. To mention all of the major problems here would run the risk of turning this review into a mere list, so I will only highlight a couple of them. For starters, our hero is a loud, obnoxious jerk that few people would want to spend any amount of time with and I fear that Butler embodies that characteristic to a T—you spend the first half of the movie hoping that the film is going to pull an “Executive Decision” and knock him out early so that the real and actually likable hero can come in and save the day. And the conspiracy angle doesn’t work because A.) the elaborate plot doesn’t make any sense even by dumb action film standards and B.) the bad guy is so patently obvious that most people will be able to figure it out just by looking at the credits on the poster. And, oh yeah, there are any number of extraneous subplots—Jake’s relationship with his disappointed moppet of a daughter and Max’s supposedly clandestine affair with a Secret Service agent (Abbie Cornish, who actually can act and whose presence here is all the more disappointing as a result)—that not only do nothing but eat up screen time but linger over the meal at length to boot.', 'It all sounds absolutely ridiculous but the real disappointment about “Geostorm” is that it doesn’t even work as the camp suggested by the trailer. Yes, there are scenes of weather-related destruction but there are only a couple of points—a sudden temperature spike in Hong Kong causing gas main explosions that level much of the city and wild lighting strikes over Orlando—where we get to see them play out at length. The rest are often reduced to brief bits that offer just enough footage to make the trailer seem a little more spectacular but not enough to help the movie. In either case, they lack the lavish visual pyrotechnics nor the wit or style to make any of the destruction slightly memorable. This is all stuff that you have seen better before—even the aforementioned bit of someone trying to outrun the cold comes directly from “The Day After Tomorrow,” a film that I am fairly certain that director/co-writer Dean Devlin is familiar with since it was directed by Roland Emmerich, the guy he collaborated with on “Stargate,” “Godzilla” and the “Independence Day” films.', 'God knows how many millions of dollars and hours of manpower went into making and remaking “Geostorm” but it turns out to have been all for naught.

And there\'s\xa0a lot of exhausting and exhaustive backstory, none of which plays to Chan\'s talents as a performer, or director Martin Campbell\'s strengths\xa0as an action filmmaker. Campbell is\xa0best known as the helmer of the franchise-reviving James Bond films ""Casino Royale"" and ""GoldenEye."" But he was probably\xa0hired to direct ""The Foreigner""\xa0because of his knack for cheesy revenge dramas, particularly the surprisingly okay 2010 ""Edge of Darkness"" remake. Sadly, none of that earlier\xa0film\'s knack for preposterous, testosterone-driven violence is here in ""The Foreigner,"" possibly because\xa0""Edge of Darkness"" screenwriter and\xa0meathead cinema poet\xa0laureate\xa0William Monahan didn\'t adapt ""The Foreigner"" too.\xa0', 'As a result, watching ""The Foreigner"" is a thoroughly dispiriting experience. You\xa0wait for characters to take a break from gabbing\xa0about Hennessy\'s connections\xa0with everyone from old IRA members to, uh, newer IRA members. But when Chan finally does swing into action, it\'s in scenes that over-emphasize his character\'s age, and lack of coordination. Chan, as Quan,\xa0falls over himself far\xa0too much. He clearly has some moves, but his\xa0character is supposed to be old and slow. So Chan must get pummeled twice for every blow he lands. Sadly,\xa0the blows that Chan does dish out\xa0are graceless and mechanical. The choreography of these scenes is intentionally\xa0ragged, even if Campbell films them well enough. Chan may still be figuring out what he can and can\'t do in his old age.

It\'s often hard to understand Barry\'s motives\xa0beyond caricature-broad assumptions about his (lack of) character. In 1977, Barry agrees to\xa0fly over South American countries and take photos of suspected communist groups using a spy plane provided by shadowy CIA pencil-pusher Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson).

Schafer, for example, is defined by the taunts he suffers\xa0from a fellow\xa0cubicle drone and his own\xa0tendency to over-promise. Schafer doesn\'t do real work—not in the filmmakers\' eyes.\xa0The same is true of Escobar and his fellow dealers, who are treated as lawless salesmen of an unsavory product.\xa0And don\'t get me started on JB (Caleb Landry Jones), Lucy\'s lazy, Gremlin-driving, under-age-girl-dating, Confederate-flag-waving redneck brother.', ""But what about Lucy?

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', ""I wouldn’t have picked Chris Hemsworth as Marvel's breakout comedy star when he was first cast as Thor, God of Thunder, but he turned out to be one of the best things about this never-ending mega-franchise. He’s tall, brawny and impossibly handsome, but there’s a self-mocking twinkle in his eye. When Thor is in gung-ho jock mode, Hemsworth’s wry machismo evokes the young Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an eyebrow at the corniness around him. When he bumbles and stumbles, there’s a touch of Cary Grant to his embarrassment. And when he’s playing things more or less straight, there’s an average guyness to his reactions. All this humanizes an actor who’s perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.\xa0   "", 'Hemsworth’s charisma holds “Thor: Ragnarok” together whenever it threatens to spin apart, which unfortunately is often. Written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost and directed by Taika Waititi (“Hunt for the Wilderpeople,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), this is almost but not quite a stand-alone picture, tethered to previous “Avengers” entries only by Thor’s opening search for the Infinity Stones, which has led him to be imprisoned by the fire demon Sutur. The demon tells him that his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard and that their homeworld will soon be destroyed in Ragnarok, a prophesied apocalypse. After that, the film splits into a couple of parallel narratives.\xa0   ', 'Fully half the film is a court intrigue/war picture, charting the takeover of Asgard by Thor’s long lost sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), a black-clad force of nature who seems to turn into a demonic stag-beast when she fights: her head sprouts elegant antlers that might have been sketched in the air with a brush dipped in India ink. The other “Thor: Ragnarok” is a largely comedic gladiator movie with prison thriller accents: Thor is trapped on the planet Sakaar, where he’s forced to fight the planet’s reigning champion, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). As revealed in trailers, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is back, too—and why wouldn’t he be? He’s easily the most entertaining villain, or antihero, in the franchise, so beguiling that when Thor inevitably succumbs to his charisma and fights alongside him, both he and the audience momentarily forget how much death and property destruction he’s caused in prior chapters.\xa0   ', 'The overqualified supporting cast does a lot with not-quite enough. Sakaar’s “Grandmaster” is Jeff Goldblum, who gives exactly the sort of performance you’d want Jeff Goldblum to give in a project like this: intellectually detached, droll and smart-alecky, yet also somehow petty, arbitrary and sadistic. Goldblum\'s unique genius is his ability to toss off lines that might\'ve seemed as overripe as week-old avocados on the page, like, ""Let\'s have a hand for all of our undercard competitors who died so gruesomely."" (From the inventive way he adds ""ums"" and ""ahhs,"" you can tell that he\'s also a jazz musician.)\xa0The worst thing I can say about him is that he’s more appealing here than well-used. Either there should have been a lot more of him—though not at the expense of Blanchett, who’s a slinky hoot—or his efforts should’ve been more finely shaped by the filmmakers, so that his brilliance cohered into a bona fide character or else pushed on towards toward Dadaist madness, like Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N. Furter in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or the late Gene Wilder’s title performance in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.” (The latter seems to have been what Waititi and company were going for in casting Goldblum: when Thor is introduced to Sakaar, “Pure Imagination” plays on the soundtrack.)\xa0   ', ""As Valkyrie, an alcoholic bounty hunter who once fought against Hela and now works for The Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson more than holds her own in scenes opposite Hiddleston, Hemsworth and Ruffalo. She's hard-boiled, like a tough dame in a 1940s detective film spitting wisecracks. As Skurge, a warrior who survives Hela’s destructive takeover of Asgard and joins her in order to survive, “Lord of the Rings” star Karl Urban captures the unhappiness of a\xa0 sellout who knows he’s better than the life he’s expediently chosen; but so much of his performance is reduced to anguished reaction shots that you may wonder—as you might with Thompson—whether the best bits got cut for pacing.\xa0   "", ""In the run-up to release, much was made of the allegedly drastic shift in tone that would make this project unique. It was sold as a light, funky, largely comedic effort—practically a spoof of Marvel’s usual, with Thor and the Hulk serving as the anchor of, basically, a buddy movie, like the kind\xa0 Bob Hope and Bing Crosby used to churn out. There are times when it gets close to that promised film, and when it hits pay dirt, it is delightful—particularly during very broad slapstick moments, as when Hulk enters the arena and Thor laughs with relief and announces, “I know him—he's a friend from work!”; and in moments of relatively subdued character development, as when Thor and Hulk commiserate in private and we learn that the big green guy loves it on Sakaar because the people treat him as an athletic superstar and folk hero, in contrast to the pariah treatment he gets back on Earth. (When you’re mainly good at Hulk Smash, it’s a relief to land a job that asks you to do nothing but.)   \xa0   "", 'When Hulk turns back into Bruce Banner, Ruffalo reminds us that he’s giving two performances here, both superb. He revels in the looming physicality of Hulk—a motion capture performance on par with Andy Serkis’ best—but when he turns back into a regular man, he seems to shrink within himself. He’s unafraid to use his shortness for laughs, appearing side-by-side against the towering Hemsworth in wide shots like the superhero answer to Laurel and Hardy. Banner’s complaints are small, too—and yet they aren’t, because of their recognizable humanity: “You’re just using me to get to Hulk,” he whines. “It’s gross. You’re a bad friend.”   \xa0   ', ""Unfortunately, as is often the case with Marvel films, the adventurous aspects aren’t adventurous enough, and the more predictable aspects—the CGI-saturated fight scenes, with bodies whirling through the air; the wide shots of cities burning and giant creatures on the rampage; the images of whooshing, twisting star gates and bodies falling from the sky like meteors—are more frenzied and loud than inspired, and eventually become monotonous. The movie's final third, yet another Marvel Big Battle, is as tedious as the first two-thirds are endearing. There's a whiff of post-colonialist critique in the presentation of Asgard as an empire that was founded on war but that now hypocritically congratulates itself for being peaceful,  but the screenplay doesn't develop the idea as well as it might. A climactic twist, which I won’t reveal here, is presented in such a tonally inappropriate way that it calls the film’s entire approach into question. (“Ant-Man”’s status as the best off-brand MCU film remains unchallenged.) Only the comic chemistry of the main quadrangle—Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Thompson and Ruffalo—prevents “Thor: Ragnarok” from devolving into another standard-issue superhero crash-and-bash fest.Still, there’s plenty to like here. Waititi, his cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (“Blue Jasmine”), and his production designer Dan Hennah take their cues from pop art-influenced comic book adaptations of the ‘60s and ‘70s, like TV’s “Batman,” “Logan’s Run,” “Flash Gordon” and “The Black Hole,” filling the screen with kitschy costumes, furniture, artifacts and machinery envisioned in the tiled, knobby style of the late, great illustrator Jack Kirby, and presenting it all in oversaturated color. The disco-drug-trip gaudiness is a welcome change of pace from superhero cinema’s default bled-by-leeches look. At one point, Thor gripes about the red-and-white patterning of the capital city's interiors, as well he should: they’re hideous. Mark Mothersbaugh, the onetime Devo co-founder and composer who scored four Wes Anderson films, creates a retro-synth soundtrack suited to the era of science fiction cinema in which characters wore jumpsuits. This is a close-but-no-cigar movie, but so enjoyable for the most part, and so modest in its aims, that its disappointments aren’t devastating. I’d watch the first 90 minutes again anytime.\xa0"", 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

With Aftermath, Dig, Save Me, Hung, and more, she’s got a new show every season now and some potential viewers might want a break from the automatic casting.', 'If people can get around such problems and make it to the door, they’ll find they’re in for a treat. As much as it might seem that a standard formula is in play, this one has a lot of spins that don’t fit the mold. It’s a show that is about the team more than anything and its first stroke of genius is to deliver dialog that mostly sounds like things people might say. The pilot can’t avoid leaning toward establishment\xa0(which is probably unnecessary), but by and large this is a\xa0show that lets things play out as though it isn’t convinced everyone watching needs the dialog to explain everything that happens.', 'Better still, though this is going to run into repetition problems when it comes to episodic content, it looks like it is going to avoid most of the irritation there by sidelining the politics every chance it gets. A lesser version of this show is basically someone’s commercial, but The Brave manages to focus on the task at hand. That’s not only a solid decision, and one that gives the show a stronger pull, it’s a difficult one to deliver, and the effort itself turns this into an experience that is more comparable to watching a film than a series.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'James Gunn’s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” opens with a franchise-defining credit sequence. As an incredibly expensive CGI battle unfolds in the background, the camera stays on an adorable Baby Groot, dancing to ELO’s “Mr. Blue Sky.” This is a series more about whimsy, excitement and family than it is “things that go boom,” and that’s what really separates in the Marvel Cinematic Universe right now. And the clever opening credits, in which the other characters have the nerve to interrupt Baby Groot’s dance number as they fight for their lives, sets the tone perfectly for what’s to come: a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster. This is the rare Hollywood CGI orgy that doesn’t take itself deadly seriously—like the current plague of superhero movies—and wants to be as purely entertaining as possible. To that end, a wave of heartfelt speeches and apocalyptic sequences hinder the final act and hold the film back from pure greatness, but you’ll have had enough fun by then that you won’t really care. To be blunt, “Vol. 2” avoids many of the flaws of the first movie, and does several things notably better. It’s fun, clever and a great kick-off to the summer movie season.', 'In keeping with the simplicity of its title, “Vol. 2” picks up relatively shortly after the end of the first film. Groot is still a baby, and the other four members of the Guardians are on a job for the Sovereign race, led by a golden woman named Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot have to defend a valuable group of batteries from a monster called the Abilisk. They do so in exchange for a prisoner being held by the Sovereigns, Gamora’s evil sister Nebula (Karen Gillan). The mission goes off without a hitch, but Rocket steals the batteries on the way out, leading a whole race of people to come after the Guardians. ', 'To seek vengeance, Ayesha ends up hiring someone who knows the Guardians well, Yondu (Michael Rooker), the blue-skinned Ravager who raised Peter, but there’s dissent among the Ravagers. For reasons that will become clear later, Yondu has essentially been exiled from his own people and his crew are starting to consider mutiny, especially when he’s reluctant to track Quill. At the same time, Quill finally meets his father, a Celestial named Ego, played with smooth style by Kurt Russell. In ways I won’t spoil, Star-Lord is eventually torn between his biological family and his makeshift one with the Guardians.', 'Of course, like Dom Toretto on a confessional bender, family comes up over and over again in “Vol. 2.” It’s most prominent in the arc between Star-Lord and Ego, but the competitive sibling dynamic between Gamora and Nebula is explored in this volume, and the adoptive father relationship between Yondu and Peter plays a major role as well. And, of course, as with so many superhero group films, it’s the Guardians themselves who are the ultimate “family.” As a writer, Gunn beats this drum a few too many times, but he mostly handles the issue of family being more than pure biology in a way that provides these films with an emotional spine other superhero flicks lack. ', 'It helps greatly that the “family” is given nearly equal development and screen time in this adventure. It would have been easy to push Pratt to the front of the stage and rest the action of the film squarely on his shoulders, but every member of the Guardians feels more fully developed this time than in the first film, which was weighed down by origin/introduction arcs. The underrated Saldana turns Gamora into the most practical member of the group; Bautista gets as many big laughs as any MCU character playing the big guy with no social filter; Cooper does great voice work as he finds how Rocket disguises insecurity with self-sabotage; even Gillan and Rooker take characters who could have felt merely supporting and give them surprising depth. This is arguably the best MCU ensemble. ', 'What’s perhaps most surprisingly enjoyable about “Vol. 2” is that Gunn doesn’t rest on his success at all in terms of production. This franchise is too big to fail on so many levels, and so it could have easily been phoned in. And yet Gunn and his team craft some of the most striking visuals of the entire MCU. There are fantastic bits of production design sprinkled throughout the film, from the Sovereigns’ “battle room” to the entirety of Ego’s planet to the grungy functionality of the Ravagers’ ship. Gunn and cinematographer Henry Braham don’t take the visuals of their billion-dollar sequel for granted, finding beauty in shots that many other filmmakers would toss away. “Vol. 2” looks surprisingly great.', ""That attention to detail extends to both the minor beats and the major action sequences, which also feel more accomplished here than in the first film. There’s an incredible break-out scene, a few nifty space battles, and while the finale is undeniably crowded, Gunn does a great job of keeping us attuned to where everyone is in the fight and what they’re doing. Most notably, the final battle takes full advantage of everyone, the action playing on character development that came before. There are elements of the final scenes (which I don't want to spoil) that feel like they fall into the trap in which every superhero movie has to climax with the apocalypse but the individual actions within those greater moments resonate more than most films of this type."", '“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” uses music in much the same way as the first film, often in-scene as a product of Star-Lord’s mix tapes. And so it’s tempting to compare this movie to the second album from an artist after a beloved breakthrough debut. Sure, the songs are familiar. You’ve heard the basic beats before. But this is no sophomore slump. It’s a film that doesn’t just repeat itself or rest on its leading man. Most of all, it’s no mere bridge to the next adventure, even if it does set up a third volume in exciting ways. Like most movie critics, I suffer a bit from superhero exhaustion. It’s unavoidable at this point in the pop culture spectrum.

It works to varying degrees of success.', 'The ten episode season takes viewers inside the medieval politics and warfare of the Knights Templar, the most powerful, wealthy, and mysterious military order of the Middle Ages who were entrusted with protecting Christianity’s most precious relics. The premiere begins after the fall of the city of Acre, the Templar’s last stronghold in the Holy Land, where the Holy Grail is lost. Years later, a clue emerges suggesting the whereabouts of the Grail and sends the Templars, led by the courageous and headstrong Landry (Tom Cullen), on a life or death mission to find the lost Cup of Christ.', 'If the above synopsis sounds unappealing to you, I would not recommend the show. While the action is epic, only history buffs will enjoy the majority of scenes. But the battles are depicted in an engaging way. It looks like Game of Thrones with a much smaller budget.', 'From a studious perspective Knightfall is an important program. The story of the Knights Templar has never been fully told until now. Were you aware the reason Friday the 13th is synonymous with bad luck is because that’s when the Templar Order’s demise occurred in 1307?

While certain recent efforts (The Mentalist, Elementary, Lie to Me) have managed to bridge the divide between focusing on geniuses and being understood by non-geniuses, Scorpion dodges the difficulty altogether, largely by doing virtually nothing that seems smart (except saying that everyone is smart at you repeatedly), and by actively showcasing the utterly ridiculous.', 'It’s a sad turn of events really, because there could be an interesting show here. Certain elements that look at the inherent difficulty of being a genius, especially those involving a small boy, would make for a worthwhile exploration, but the show is more interested in laughable bits of derring do. More importantly, it would seem that we’re convinced that no one would understand anything smart people do, or at least that no one wants to watch them, because anything related to all the “smart” we keep mentioning is only the result of a quick explanation, and as little actual effort as possible. Being an “engineering genius” means flipping the only five switches in a transformer box, being the “genius genius” (I guess) means describing whatever hacking you’re doing, most of which is apparently accomplished by typing for about five seconds, and being a “psychological genius,” well… is just a fairly goofy thing to suggest exists, but manifests in spouting a few bullet points from Psychology for Dummies once in a while.', 'The worst part about this truly odd spectacle is that, with the exception of Katharine McPhee (who is no better off than she was in Smash), the actors all show that they could deal with better material. Elyes Gabel, who stars as O’Brien, pulls some depth out of even the oddest demands of the script, and occasionally looks as though he is desperate to roll his eyes during the show’s less interesting moments. Eddie Kaye Thomas and Ari Stidham are especially wasted, despite the fact that their charisma could hold viewers. The little these two are given to do only highlights how much they deserve more, and ought to be working characters that are less one-note.', 'As we move through the establishment of the our genius crew, we only get them as a list of social dysfunction and geek speak. The prevailing attitude is one that suggests that as your I.Q. goes up, your ability to act like a “human” goes down. This is coupled with the show’s belief that you’re too stupid to understand anything these characters might explain, so we’ll either gloss over everything very quickly, or we’ll “explain it in a way that you can understand.”', 'The save for this one might come if it lasts through about six episodes. Once it gets over trying to establish things, it might be able to settle into its characters, and build some life into them. Especially considering the idea that the show is keen to refer to itself as “based on a true story,” we’re going to have to see a lot more character, and a lot less of ridiculous stunts with airliners lowering computer cables to cars driving under them by way of a pilot climbing down the landing the gear. There’s a realism gap the show needs to work on (I hope), and it covers far more than the downright silly stunts.', 'The end result is that it becomes hard to know who the show is targeting. If you’re looking for bizarro action, or nonsensical “displays of genius,” you probably aren’t after the rest of the show’s efforts, or any effort purporting to be about a group of geniuses. It’s a disjointed mess at this point, and one that almost seems to be trying to distance itself from audiences.

Gary Gray jumps into one of the most successful franchises of all time with “The Fate of the Furious,” the eighth\xa0installment in a series that seems increasingly critic-proof. How big are these movies? They have made almost $4 billion worldwide, with the last one shattering the previous series record, bringing in $1.5 billion on its own. There are big franchises and then there’s “The Fast and the Furious” movies, which have found the perfect blend of international appeal, ridiculous action and, of course, an emphasis on “family,” whatever that word means to you. Regardless of reviews, this series is too big to fail. It’s going to be around for a very long time. But that doesn’t mean we can’t be disappointed that “The Fate of the Furious” distinctly drops the level of quality in this series for the first time this decade.', 'With a series that has been this wide-ranging in terms of critical appeal, it feels like a declaration of taste is appropriate. I didn’t care much about the films at all until “Fast Five” although I agreed that “The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift” took more risks and was more fun than the awful second (""2 Fast 2 Furious"") and possibly-worst fourth film (""Fast & Furious""). It took five movies to figure out the franchise, turning them into roller coasters that alternated between cartoonish action set pieces and heartfelt conversations about makeshift families. They seemed like the answer to “What if we made the entire movie like those insane opening bits from the Bond movies? Plus family.” And the series only got better with the inclusion of new faces like Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Kurt Russell. Yes, they’re ridiculous—but that’s also why they’re fun. ', ""So, why isn’t “The Fate of the Furious” more fun? That’s going to be the question to which you keep returning as you watch all 136 minutes of this film that’s relatively enjoyable when compared to other hollow blockbusters but relatively disappointing when compared to the high points of this series. First and foremost, it’s a movie that’s over two hours long and has almost no plot. Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) betrays his team after being forced to work against them by a Bond-esque supervillain named Cipher (Charlize Theron). They work to stop him and get him back in their “family.” That’s about it. Throughout, almost everyone gets one-and-a-half emotions. Michelle Rodriguez does the most she can with her blend of confusion and love for the man that may be trying to kill her now. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson do a lot with their characters' rivalry, even it feels more like a Shane Black ‘80s action comedy than this series ever has before. Even the settings seem thin in terms of writing. The action jumps around the globe in a way that looks calculated for international appeal more than any real use of location. I picture a whiteboard in the writers room that says “Cuba=Hot, Russia=Cold.” And while it’s become something of a joke to say that these films are all about “family,” it really functions like a crutch here. They use the word over a dozen times, almost as if it’s the fallback when they couldn’t think of anything else plot-wise to link the action sequences."", 'And here’s where the defenders of the Furious Flame kick in with the chorus that plot doesn’t matter to these films. It’s all about adrenaline, and no one cares that the filmmakers forgot to give at least half the characters anything memorable to do this time around. And there are times when “The Fate of the Furious” bursts into escapist lunacy in which it’s easy to agree. The “big” sequences work, especially a bit with a wave of hacked self-driving cars in New York City and the climactic chaos in Russia that almost feels like it’s mocking the “longest runway in the world” sequence from “Fast & Furious 6” in terms of MPH inconsistency. When “The Fate of the Furious” gives viewers what they’re really paying that ticket price to see, there’s an undeniably goofy, playful, fun time to be had. It’s all the other stuff that starts to really annoy.', 'This failing in the material that connects the action sequences is never more prominent than when Charlize Theron is on screen. ""The Fate of the Furious"" will go down as one of the largest wastes of a major talent in a blockbuster film in years. Likely cast because of how much ass she kicked in “Mad Max: Fury Road,” writer Chris Morgan then neglects to give Theron a single notable action sequence. She’s stuck on a high-tech plane, issuing orders to other people on the ground below. How on Earth do you bring in Imperator Furiosa and not make her race against Dom Toretto? She has one interesting sequence early in the movie, in which she and “Evil Dom” overtake the team, which makes the rest of her arc feel like even more of a disappointment because one sees what she could have done. There’s no heat to this character whatsoever—no physicality, no sexuality, no passion. We don’t even really know why she’s doing what she’s doing, and you can actually see Theron start to get bored. This franchise has always had a villain problem—although it’s increasingly interesting that every villain eventually becomes a hero—but this seems like the biggest misfire, not only in terms of wasted opportunity but how much time Theron is forced to deliver dull, useless exposition.', ""It’s tempting to blame the relative failures of this movie on the loss of the underrated Paul Walker or the new director. The action scenes are well-done, but the rest is surprisingly dull given what Gray has delivered in the past, leading one to believe he was purely for hire. The spectacle works. That’s something we’ve come to expect. I suspect it will continue to work for a few more films. But if they’re going to rise to the entertainment level they’ve hit before, this series needs someone behind the wheel who can make those narrative valleys between the peaks of the roller coaster ride more memorable. Find a writer who can write more interesting dialogue. Find a director who can add visual flair when cars aren’t going boom. Give your increasingly gigantic supporting cast something to do. Of course, none of this will hold “The Fate of the Furious” back from box office glory.

He records conversations had around him (almost always around and not with him) on an old-fashioned mini-cassette recorder, and then mixes them into songs with some wonderfully antiquated keyboard and rhythm equipment. The first one we see him create is called “Was He Slow,” using a question asked by an accomplice about Baby’s mental capacity as a hook. Much like Baby turns the world around him into music, writer/director Edgar Wright remixes the movies and tunes that have influenced him into the wildly joyous and fantastically entertaining “Baby Driver.” As CGI robots clang into each other and superheroes take to the sky, here’s Wright to ask if you remember how movies used to thrill us with a turn of phrase, a squeal of a wheel, a diving plot twist, or a romantic kiss. “Baby Driver” feels both influenced by the modern era of self-aware, pop-culture filmmaking and charmingly old-fashioned at the same time, which is only one of its minor miracles. It’s as much fun as you’re going to have in a movie theater this year.', 'Yes, his name is “B-A-B-Y, Baby” (Ansel Elgort). At least, that’s the name he gives people when asked, although he’s more often ignored. He’s the nearly silent getaway driver for a robbery syndicate managed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organizes the crime, hires three criminals, and then puts them in Baby’s car. You see, Baby can drive. But he needs music to do it. After a car accident as a kid left him with tinnitus, he spends the vast majority of his waking hours with ear buds in his ears to drown out the ringing. And the world around him moves to the music on one of his many iPods—he has various ones for different moods. Sometimes the world seems to respond to his choice, sometimes his choice seems to influence the world around him—either way, music is as essential to the success of “Baby Driver” as it was to “La La Land,” maybe more.', ""Take the riveting first scene. Three criminals—Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Griff (Jon Bernthal)—leap from a car outside of a bank just as Baby cues up “Bellbottoms” by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in his 'buds. Everything from this point on moves in rhythm with the music from the slamming of the car doors after the bank robbers return to the squealing tires of one of the best car chase scenes in years. We’ve seen countless action scenes scored to pop or rock songs, but how many have you seen in which the action works in unison with the music? And Wright takes this brilliant concept a step further, making even everyday normal activity feel like it’s part of Baby’s soundtrack. The sound of someone typing a text message on a phone or placing stacks of money on a table will work with the beat of a song, creating a film that has a rhythm, flow and structure from first frame to last that works in conjunction with its soundtrack. It’s fluid and jaw-dropping—the kind of thing you want to see immediately again after it’s over to catch all the things you missed."", 'The last paragraph probably makes “Baby Driver” sound like a music video, and has likely pushed out potential viewers looking for more substance than style. Trust me when I say that Wright doesn’t skimp on the former. There’s enough story and action here to satisfy without the music that drives the filmmaking. Much of the joy of this film is watching it unfold so I’ll be brief with plot. Baby had a brief dalliance with crime, and he made the mistake of robbing from Doc, who now forces him to drive as penance. He’s almost done. He has one more job for Doc and then he’ll be back to his normal life. Of course, we all know how that typically turns out in crime movies. And when Baby meets a lovely waitress named Debora (Lily James), he finds a reason to go straight. That’s all you need to know.', 'At its core, “Baby Driver” recalls decades of movies that anchored their narratives on criminals and the art of the car chase. There’s a remarkably old-fashioned sensibility to the way Wright structures and details his film, and it’s not just because his two genetically blessed stars look like they could have walked out of a 1940s noir (their All-American aesthetic is even more striking in a few gorgeous black-and-white shots that recall old Hollywood even more). “Baby Driver” is a high-concept film that never underwhelms detail, and it’s those charming little beats within the overall tune that hold it together.', 'It helps greatly that few people know how to assemble a cast like Edgar Wright. Elgort and James are engaging, charismatic leads with fantastic chemistry. Unlike most Hollywood action movies, the survival of the heroes here becomes something we actively root for instead of just know is likely to happen. The “villains” of the piece are perfectly cast and directed as well, particularly Spacey and Jamie Foxx as the menacing Bats. Both roles are written and cast in a way that they could have stolen focus with performances that play to the cheap seats but neither actor ever does. Foxx is particularly phenomenal in a role that’s both funny and filled with simmering danger. It’s one of those films where every single role, from the burly diner chef to the sweet post office employee, feels like it was cast with exactly the right person. It creates a sense of additional magic in a film when you can sense that every single element, even the most minor ones, is working exactly as its creator intended.', 'There’s an energy that you can feel in the theater when a movie is really working. It’s the guy next to you jumping a bit in his seat as a car takes a hard corner. It’s the woman behind you laughing extra hard at a joke. It’s the sense that everyone is fully engaged, almost tapping their feet to the rhythm of the film. I still believe this is why most people go to the movies with crowds of strangers—to feel that shared magic and nod their heads in unison to the cinematic tune. “Baby Driver” will be one of your favorite songs of the year.

Directed by Lee Unkrich (""Toy Story 3"") and veteran Pixar animator Adrian Molina, and drawing heavily on Mexican folklore and traditional designs, it has catchy music, a complex but comprehensible plot, and bits of domestic comedy and media satire. Most of the time the movie is a knockabout slapstick comedy with a ""Back to the Future"" feeling, staging grand action sequences and feeding audiences new plot information every few minutes, but of course, being a Pixar film, ""Coco"" is also building toward emotionally overwhelming moments, so stealthily that you may be surprised to find yourself wiping away a tear even though the studio has been using the\xa0sneak-attack\xa0playbook for\xa0decades.   ', ""The film's hero, twelve-year old Miguel Riviera (voice by Anthony Gonzalez), lives in the small town of Santa Cecilia. He’s a goodhearted child who loves to play guitar and idolizes the greatest popular singer-songwriter of the 1920s and '30s, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), who was killed when a huge church bell fell on his head. But Miguel has to busk in secret because his family has banned its members from performing music ever since Miguel's great-great-grandfather left, abandoning his loved ones to selfishly pursue his dreams of stardom. At least that’s the official story passed down through the generations; it’ll be challenged as the film unfolds, not through a traditional detective story (although there’s a mystery element to “Coco”) but through an “Alice in Wonderland” journey to the Land of the Dead, which the hero accesses through the tomb of his ancestors.\xa0   "", 'Family and legacy as expressed through storytelling and song: this is the deeper preoccupation of “Coco.” One of the most fascinating things about the movie is the way it builds its plot around members of Miguel’s family, living and dead, as they battle to determine the official narrative of Miguel’s great-great grandfather and what his disappearance from the narrative meant for the extended clan. The title character is the hero’s great-grandmother (Renee Victor), who was traumatized by her dad’s disappearance. In her old age, she has become a nearly silent presence, sitting in the corner and staring blankly ahead, as if hypnotized by a sweet, old film perpetually unreeling in her mind.   ', 'The machinations that get Miguel to the other side are too complicated to explain in a review, though they’re comprehensible as you watch the movie. Suffice to say that Miguel gets there, teams up with a melancholy goofball named Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and has to pose as one of the dead with the aid of skeletal facepaint, but that (like Marty McFly returning to the 1950s to make sure his mom ends up with his dad in “Future”) the longer Miguel stays on the other side, the more likely he is to end up actually dead.   ', 'I’m reluctant to describe the film’s plot in too much detail because, even though every twist seems obvious in retrospect, Molina and Matthew Aldrich’s script frames each one so that seems delightful and inevitable. Many of them are conveyed through a stolen family photograph that Miguel brings with him to the Land of the Dead. The deployment of the photo is a great example of how to tell a story through pictures, or more accurately, with a picture. Somebody’s face has been torn out; there’s a guitar that proves to be important later, and there are other ways in which visual information has been withheld from Miguel (and us) so that it can be revealed or restored when the time is right, completing and correcting an incomplete or distorted picture, and ""picture.”', 'What’s freshest, though, is the tone and outlook of the film. “Coco” opened in Mexico a month before it opened in the USA and is already the highest grossing film of all time there. It assumes a non-American point-of-view on spirituality and culture—not in a touristy or “thought experiment” sort of way, but as if it were merely the latest product of an alternate universe Pixar Mexicano that has existed for just as long as the other one. The film’s stable of voice actors reads like a Who’s Who of Latin-American talent: the ensemble includes Edward James Olmos, Alfonso Arau, Ana Ofelia Murguia, Alanna Ubach and, in a small role, to my surprise and astonishment, playwright Octavio Solis, who was one of my teachers in high school back in Dallas. Michael Giacchino\'s score is unsurprisingly excellent, as are the original songs—in particular, the future Oscar winner ""Remember Me,"" the greatest tear-eruption mechanism to accompany a Pixar release since the ""Toy Story 2"" centerpiece ""When She Loved Me.""', 'Like most Pixar productions, this one is filled with homages to film history in general and animation history in particular. I was especially fond of the references to the dancing skeletons that seemed to pop up constantly in cartoon shorts from the 1930s. There’s a touch of Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki in the film’s matter-of-fact depiction of the dead interacting with the living, as well as its portrayal of certain creatures, such as a goofy, goggle-eyed dog named Dante (modeled on Xoloitzcuintli, the national dog of Mexico) and a gigantic flying dragon-type beast with the personality of a plump old housecat. ', 'Also notable are the film\'s widescreen compositions, which put lots of characters in the same frame and shoot them from\xa0the waist up or from head-to-toe, in the manner of old musicals, or\xa0Hollywood comedies from the eighties like ""9 to 5"" or ""Tootsie."" The direction lets you appreciate how the characters interact with each other and with their environments and lets you decide what to look at. At first this approach seems counter-intuitive for a movie filled with fantastic creatures, structures and situations, but it ends up being effective for that very reason: it makes you feel as though you\'re seeing a record of things that are actually happening, and it makes ""Coco"" feel gentle and unassuming even though it\'s a big, brash, loud film.

He is a vital member of the community: helping forgetful neighbors, running errands for friends and generally making everyone’s day a little brighter.', 'But back in Peru, his dear Aunt Lucy (voiced once more by Imelda Staunton, part of the formidable cast of veteran British actors) is about to turn 100, and Paddington wants to buy her the perfect gift. When he discovers an intricate, vintage pop-up book of London in the antique store owned by old pal Mr. Gruber (Jim Broadbent), he knows he’s found the ideal item to express his love for the woman—er, mama bear— who raised him.', '(The pop-up book sequence is THE highlight in a film filled with dazzling special effects. Paddington’s fur is vividly tactile, and his immersion in this live-action world is absolutely seamless. His antics may be wild but they’re always grounded from a visual perspective. But when the pages of the pop-up book come to life through a variety of animated styles—and Paddington finds himself wandering through them as he tells the story of Aunt Lucy’s love for London—it’s transporting both visually and emotionally.)', 'So Paddington takes a series of odd jobs to raise the money to buy the book—and King meticulously crafts the set-ups to the inevitable meltdowns that occur with each new gig. (You can see the wheels turning, but it’s still hilarious to watch them fall off every time.) But he isn’t the only one who has his eye on it.', 'A washed-up actor turned dog-food pitchman with the dashing name of Phoenix Buchanan also wants the book to explore its hidden secrets for his own nefarious purposes. Just as Nicole Kidman clearly relished camping it up as the evil taxidermist hunting Paddington in the first film, Hugh Grant wallows flamboyantly in this character’s delusional theatricality. The increasing villainy of the ‘90s rom-com darling, all the way through the “Bridget Jones” movies and culminating here, is truly a joy to behold. Outwardly charming but inwardly devious, Phoenix Buchanan is the role Grant was destined to play.', 'When he breaks into the shop one night and steals the book, Paddington gets framed for the crime and winds up in prison. Sounds dark—but here’s where the twee Wes Anderson influences that were so prevalent in the original “Paddington” manifest themselves once more. Not only does Paddington accidentally dye his fellow prisoners’ uniforms a cheerful shade of pink when he’s on laundry duty (a sight King frames with precise symmetry), he also charms the meanest guy in the joint—prison cook Knuckles McGinty (Brendan Gleeson)—by introducing him to his favorite food, the very civilized marmalade.', 'No matter what gets thrown in his direction—be it wrongful incarceration, dastardly adversaries or just plain mean words—Paddington finds a way through with his sense of self intact by holding tight to a deceptively simple philosophy. When you’re kind to others, he figures, everything will turn out alright in the end. It’s no spoiler to say that Paddington clears his good name with the help of his family and friends, but you may be surprised to discover how touching the resolution to all his troubles is.', '“Paddington 2” may not be the novel revelation that its predecessor was, but it has its heart—and its stomach—in the right place.

animation "['The strangest thing is the Duffer brothers’ apparent obsession with giving starring roles to only-available-in-North-America sweet things.', 'Stranger Things 2\nNetflix’s most talked about show (well, unless you count House of Cards for all the wrong reasons) returns wth a second season that isn’t just a continuation, it’s a sequel — note how it’s officially called Stranger Things 2 (which briefly sent IMDb skwiffy), and how the episode titles aren’t Chapters Nine to Seventeen of Stranger Things but Chapters One to Nine of Stranger Things 2. Set almost a whole year after the first season, and telling a self contained story (though one that obviously builds out of the first season) which takes place over just a couple of days (in fact, more or less half the season takes place on a single day and night), it feels more like watching a follow-up movie than the next set of instalments in a series that is reported to run another two years yet.', 'The idea is emphasised further by the fact its form seems largely inspired by The Empire Strikes Back — well, it’s Stranger Things: of course it borrows heavily from an ’80s movie. (If you want to see a whole array of its visual homages/rip-offs in a succinct two-minute video, check out this.) It doesn’t map one-for-one onto Empire’s structure, but it takes the same broad shape: splitting our heroes up into different smaller groups off having their own adventures; throwing new characters into the mix; expanding the universe and the mythos. If anything, Eleven is Luke — by herself, learning about her past, developing her telekinetic abilities. And Dustin and Lucas are kind of Han and Leia — supporting characters now given their own important arc, including both romance and the introduction of a major new character. And so Mike is… I dunno, Obi-Wan? A former main character who’s now barely present. As for Joyce, and Hopper, and Nancy and Jonathan, and Steve, and Will… yeah, Star Wars doesn’t have this many lead characters. Well, I did say it wasn’t exactly like-for-like.', 'Perhaps another side effect of the movie-esque style is that it feels… short. Like, just as things seem to be getting going, it’s the finale. It’s a problem many binge-focussed series have these days, but this struck me as a particularly pronounced example. It could just be my own fault for watching it all in double-bills, but then I do that quite routinely with Netflix shows and I’ve not felt it so keenly before. Nonetheless, it has enough moving parts that the two-part finale (it’s not officially billed as that, but it is that) remains highly satisfying. As with season one, it’s when everyone finally comes together to fight the threat that the season is at its most satisfying, those two episodes feeling like an adrenaline-fuelled mini-movie (well, movie-length movie) of their own.', 'Now, you can’t discuss Stranger Things 2 without mentioning the infamous Chapter Seven. If you’ve missed the internet’s collective exclamation of disappointment and/or annoyance, IMDb has it in a nutshell: on there, the user ratings of all the other episodes (from both seasons) range from 8.5 to 9.5, a spread of 1.0 (obviously), but Chapter Seven has 6.2, a full 2.3 marks below the next lowest score. Ouch. It’s not great, but I didn’t think it was that bad. It’s a total aside from the main action, and placed where it is seems designed just to delay the pay-off to Chapter Six’s cliffhanger for another 45 minutes (in a regular programme it’d be two weeks, but this is Netflix). I don’t really hold with that being an actual problem, though — that’s just taste. No, the real problem is that it rushes through a character arc for Eleven that would’ve been better presented over multiple episodes. Considering before that she’s spent several episodes just sat around watching TV, there were surely better ways to structure her role this season.', 'That’s no slight on Millie Bobby Brown’s performance, mind — she’s great again, displaying so much character and emotion even through Eleven’s limited understanding of being a normal person. Also worthy of note is Noah Schnapp as Will. Considering he had so little to do in season one, they either lucked out with his casting or knew where they were going enough to cast it well — a lot is asked of him here, and he’s up to it. I could keep going, but if we begin to single people out we’ll be here all day: almost every lead cast member gets either a stand-out scene or a decent arc. They even made Steve likeable. Finn Wolfhard draws the short straw — Mike spends most of the season just being grumpy about Eleven — but as he was the centre of attention last time it’s okay to let the others shine.', 'Even though it has all the big action stuff you’d expect, Chapter Nine still devotes a serious chunk of time to a character-focussed epilogue; reminding you that, as with most loved shows, the heart of it is the characters and their relationships. Indeed, although the season as a whole didn’t have the same effectiveness as the first, I thought the finale was a better climax. In fact, it would be a perfectly valid place to leave the entire series… but there are (at least) two more seasons to go. It might be nice if season three opened up the timeline a bit, because so far Hawkins seems to be a place where Crazy Terrible Shit happens over a couple of days and then everything’s fine for a whole year.', 'Red Dwarf XII \xa0Episodes 4-6\nI had nice things to say about the first half of Red Dwarf XII in my last TV column, which kindly glossed over the fact that episode three, Timewave, was a bit of a disaster. I think it’s safe to say the second half of the series is stronger — it represents everything I said last time, but better. The final two episodes, M-Corp and Skipper, even throw in some fan-pleasing callbacks — real deep-dives too, aimed squarely at the long-term fanbase. (No spoilers here — the last episode has been available on demand for a week but doesn’t officially air until tonight.) The episodes don’t need such devotee delights just to curry favour — their concept-driven comedy is satisfying enough to stand on its own — but there’s no denying the added pleasure to be found in the references and cameos. You can certainly hear the glee of the live studio audience as they recognise what’s going on each time (it even messes up the pacing of one bit for us regular viewers, but I guess that’s the trade-off). So, even more than last time, this set of episodes demonstrate there’s definitely life in the old Dwarf yet. Bring on series XIII.', 'Peaky Blinders \xa0Series 3\nBeginning with a significant time-jump and monumental change in circumstance worthy of a Mad Men season premiere, the third series of Peaky Blinders soon sees everyone’s favourite Brummie gangsters embroiled in espionage and counter-espionage as they’re enlisted to help exiled Russian aristocracy launch a bid to reclaim their country. There’s so much more going on than that, but I won’t get into it here because we’ll be here all day — Peaky Blinders is a complexly plotted series; right up the final episode, which contains revelations that turn the previous six hours on their head. Even with all that narrative to get through, it still finds plenty of time to give most of its large-ish ensemble cast some strong character arcs. There are a few streaming series that could learn a thing or two from that…', 'Rick and Morty \xa0Season 1 Episode 2\nI confess: I started watching Rick and Morty fully expecting to hate it. I’d always thought it looked and sounded annoying, so I paid it no heed… but then it seemed to keep coming up — people referring to it in excited tones, and it ranking 7th on IMDb’s top TV list. So I decided to see what all the fuss was about, still expecting my initial impressions to be proved correct but endeavouring to have an open mind. The pilot (which I covered back in August) did little to sway my mind: it wasn’t terrible, but it had many of the irritations I’d perceived and only a few redeeming qualities. But I read that it was an unrepresentative and below par episode, so I pressed on. Things immediately pick up: the second episode, Lawnmower Dog, mixes together Inception, Nightmare on Elm Street, and super-intelligent canines into an entertaining and clever half-hour. It’s bought my attention for a couple more episodes, at any rate.', 'Things to Catch Up On\nThis month, I have mostly been missing Mindhunter, David Fincher’s new Netflix series about the early days of criminal psychology and criminal profiling at the FBI. It was actually released before my last TV post, but I didn’t have Netflix at the time so I didn’t bother to mention it. I would watch it next, but The Punisher is out tomorrow. Maybe after that…', 'And again, I’ve seen… none of the above. I must be an outcast from the cultural Zeitgeist or something. Sure, I’ve not got Netflix and unlikely to anytime soon, but there’s American God’s and Outlander season 3 on Amazon that I haven’t gotten around to yet. And I’ve missed a new series of Red Dwarf. And the new AHS show sits on my TiVo. Good grief…', 'Yeah, there’s always way too much stuff — so many things on my “I’ll watch that next” list that then get supplanted because something new comes out. And to think Disney are going to wade into this with their own streaming service with exclusive content! Ugh.', 'What Disney are doing could’ve massive. If they could launch a streaming service which had exclusivity of all Disney content (say it was the only place to see Marvel, Star Wars and Disney movies and TV shows). That would be seismic. Imagine if they then also ceased physical discs, if literally the only way to watch that stuff outside cinemas was that streaming service… They could name their own price. Scarier than anything in Stranger Things, I bet. And more of a dystopia than Blade Runner 2049.', 'Jeez, I hadn’t even thought of that. But I would not be at all surprised if that’s their intended endgame. Why license stuff to other platforms when you can keep it exclusive to your own? Why release physical media when you competition doesn’t? Plus they’re smart enough to know they can’t just do it instantly, so it’ll be a gradual shift over the next however-many years, so that people just accept it. And if anyone can pull it off its Disney — they’ve got both the money to weather it and the popularity of the content.', 'I think that’s why Netflix are getting into making movies and Amazon also investing heavily in content (Lord of the Rings TV show? Ker-ching!). The days of Sky, Virgin cable etc are possibly numbered- possibly even cinemas ultimately. Content is king. Why sell to distribution networks if you can distribute it yourself?

What the world needs now is Ferdinand, sweet Ferdinand, a rare breed of bovine who takes a stand against aggression, competitive rivalry and conforming to the expectations of others. ', 'Alas, the box-office force will be with “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” this weekend, while audiences will likely continue to be loco for “Coco,” Pixar’s tribute to Mexican culture. Hence, one must admire whoever had the cajones to release this pacifist-leaning animated fable based on a beloved 1936 children’s picture-book about a “toro” whose muscular build belies his soulful nature. Instead of locking horns with other bulls or dodging a matador’s red cape, Ferdinand would rather stop and smell the posies—especially the red ones. As he asks his father, “Can I be the champion of not fighting?”', 'Fox’s ‘toon factory Blue Sky is often more of a stealth player when it comes to touting its family films as opposed to the chest thumping that Disney and DreamWorks embrace. But lowered expectations aren’t a bad thing at times. That is why “Ferdinand” comes as a mostly pleasant surprise in a year that has produced a lack of stellar animated outings and stands in stark contrast to less savory aspects of “The Boss Baby” and “The LEGO Batman Movie.” Yes, there is padding afoot in the plotting, including a group dance-off, a too-long chase through a crowded city as well as an excess of chatty critters. But instead of being crude and rude, director Carlos Saldanha—a veteran of the “Ice Age” franchise whose “Rio” films were love letters to his native Brazil—and his writing team chose to extol such virtues as respect for others, teamwork, kindness and following your dream even if you are being coerced to do otherwise. ', 'When we first meet Ferdinand as a calf, he doesn’t join in the macho games and trash talk enjoyed by his corral companions. He’d rather nurture a pretty carnation that has sprouted in their training pen than brag about his future prowess in the ring. But when his father fails to return after being picked to face a matador, Ferdinand runs away and finds himself on a farm awash in fragrant buds and becomes a pet to Nina, a young girl who lives there with her dad. As in the source material, Ferdinand grows to immense proportions yet maintains his docile nature. But a run-in with a bee causes him to become atypically ferocious and he is sent back to train with his old buddies. ', 'He is assigned a wonky-toothed, googly-eyed calming goat named Lupe (Kate McKinnon, a stitch in hyper sidekick mode) who coaches the grown-up Ferdinand (infectiously voiced by wrestling superstar John Cena) in the art of the fight. But her heavyweight contender has no interest in charging at a red cape, especially after he figures out that a bull either ends up going to the “chop shop”—a rather terrifying meat factory that is bluntly dealt with—or is sacrificed for the sake of blood sport in the ring. It’s the opposite of a win-win. But that doesn’t prevent Ferdinand from being selected as a worthy opponent by the revered matador El Primero (Miguel Angel Silvestre) for his farewell appearance in the arena and puts his resistance to the test.\xa0\xa0 ', 'There are some clever sequences that make the most out Ferdinand’s considerable girth and natural grace, including one that capitalizes on the cliché “bull in a china shop” with nifty choreographed slapstick that wouldn’t be out of place in a W.C. Fields comedy from the ‘40s. Though it is brief, I was charmed by a sight gag where Ferdinand accidentally gets a caterpillar stuck in his nose and quickly sneezes it out in the form of a beautiful butterfly. While Nina’s shaggy dog Paco doesn’t quite get how he and Ferdinand can be brothers, as the bull claims, his wagging tail is an endearing tell that he obviously agrees. And while their presence in the movie is seemingly superfluous, there is a trio of vain mane-tossing Lipizzaners in the next field who try to outdo the other animals with their prance moves. When their exhausted leader, Hans (German comic Flula Borg), flops to the ground, I admit to laughing when he declares, “I’ve fallen—and I can’t giddy-up.” ', 'I also admired whoever chose such an eclectic quartet of actors to speak for Ferdinand’s bullring buddies: Bobby Cannavale as brutish Valiente, Anthony Anderson as skinny Bones, football legend Peyton Manning as skittish Guapo and David Tennant of “Doctor Who” fame as Angus, who hails from the Scottish highlands. But what is truly amazing about this film is how thoughtfully “Ferdinand” questions male gender expectations, considering the form of the message also showcases a trio of goofy hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs) and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias).

It continues to dominate the marketplace in adult-natured cartoons with only and occasional cable series like “South Park” or something from the Adult Swim line to give it any competition.', 'With the shows from Seth MacFarlane crowding the marketplace, this is a welcome break from what has become the standard (and it plays so much fresher than that “Cleveland Show” spin-off). It’s a more subtle comedy than either “The Simpsons” or the MacFarlane line, throwing in a lot of dry humor from the parents. The zaniness and freshness comes from the children, mainly because they don’t feel like retreads of other animated, inappropriate children from other shows.', 'Making jokes about child molesters, puberty, necrophilia, cannibalism and good, old-fashioned murder, “Bob’s Burgers” doesn’t shy away from topics. Still, it’s not overtly a gross-out show, either.', 'The anchor of the show is Bob, voiced by H. John Benjamin, whom many people will recognize as the voice of Archer in his own series.

She’s the Bart Simpson or Eric Cartman of the bunch, playing dangerously precocious and manipulating situations. However, the son Gene, who seems to be a bit of a moron with some alarming health problems, has some great moments too.', 'But I think my favorite character is the other daughter, Tina, who was originally conceived as a boy.

animation "['Presenting itself as the first in a scheduled trilogy, Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters is a visually pleasing but largely unfulfilling animated film. For large periods of Godzilla, expository dialogue detailing backstory around the history of Planet Earth dominates the run time with the latter period of the film used to tease big action to come in future instalments. Whilst the ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered and sets the scene nicely for a second instalment, there just isn’t enough here to get really excited about the franchise in an uneventful and lackluster film.', 'The story begins with the behemoth Godzilla decimating Planet Earth, forcing the remaining humans to leave and try to find another planet to inhabit. After a fruitless search and many years later, the Earthlings decide to return to Earth and fight Godzilla to claim their homeland back. The premise is relatively straight forward although things do inevitably go sour toward the end of the film with the promise of some explosive action to come. With a distinct lack of memorable characters, Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters makes for a passive watch, leaving little room to get invested in any of the characters. The main draw here is of course Godzilla himself but the initial enthusiasm and excitement toward seeing the large monster is soured somewhat with little reason to care about the humans trying to defeat him.', 'Aside from lead character Metphies (Lucien Dodge) whose vengeance fueled mission to destroy Godzilla gives him some motivation around his actions, none of the other characters are explored in any real detail. It’s a shame too because the animation is gorgeously rendered, blending a unique CGI and anime style to impressive effect. Although the colors are a little dull and emotionless, it fits with the overall mood of the film and can be forgiven. Visually, there’s no denying that Godzilla is a stunning film but the plot and characterization just don’t match up to the animation.', 'Whether you’ll feel fulfilled enough here to see this trilogy through to its end will probably hinder on whether the crucial and second part of this trilogy delivers, if you can make it that far. The end certainly leaves a lot resting on this after a lackluster and ultimately uneventful first film.

They also feature Stewie and Brian for the most part, which is always an audience favorite.', 'What makes the other episodes work is that Stewie and Brian are often downplayed into secondary roles to make way for Peter, Lois, Chris and Meg to take center stage. We have the same non-sequitur humor, and that’s starting to cut away for longer and longer takes. Sometimes that works – like when Peter literally flashes to the entire music video of Mick Jagger and David Bowie’s “Dancing in the Streets” music video.

It suffers from a rushed, jumbled quality, and it displays a lot of tics that have become tiresome because DreamWorks has been doing them over and over again for 15+ years, ever since they worked in the original ""Shrek"": these include frenetic action scenes, up-to-the-minute slang that will be dated six months from now, and the use of workhorse pop songs, including Aretha Franklin\'s ""Respect,"" to pump up humor and sentiment even though the scene might\'ve played fine without them. (It\'s like watching a kid put extra sugar on sugary cereal.) ', 'But there\'s also a lot to like here. I haven\'t been this pleasantly surprised by a big-budget, little-kid focused animated film since the original ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" It\'s straight-up ridiculous from start to finish, from the razor-toothed mini-toilets that creep across the screen at the end to its many throwaway sight gags, like the bit where the boys dig through a drawer where the principal has stashed their confiscated toys and withdraw a squirt rifle twice the size of the drawer. It\'s at its best when it\'s cutting loose and delivering slapstick and fantasy sequences of escalating absurdity. When George and Harold are separated by Captain Underpants\' humorless alter-ego, Mr. Krupp, they imagine themselves separated by a desolate rocky plain, then a sea of stars, then a galaxy. ', 'Aside from a few earnest, brief paeans to the power of friendship and the necessity of recognizing others\' loneliness, there\'s not much that seems intended to turn kids into better people, and that\'s a big reason why so many of them are going to like it. The movie reminded me a little bit of my daughter\'s comment after visiting the various Disney World theme parks at age eight: ""My favorite one is Magic Kingdom, because that\'s the only one where you don\'t have to learn anything."" ', ""Director and co-writer David Soren and screenwriter Nicholas Stoller  clearly adore the source material, a series of paperback tall-tales  aimed at ten-year old children's giggle-centers. They've preserved Pilkey's exuberant drawing style as well as his understanding of what sort of humor is guaranteed to make young kids laugh until their sides hurt: clever, talkative hustlers getting out of jams they created themselves; snooty or hateful characters getting their comeuppance; anything having to do with poop, toilets, underwear, yucky lunchroom food, and adults falling down and being humiliated and chastising hordes of laughing children for not respecting their dignity; and funny voices. Always funny voices. Orange juice spit-take funny."", 'Parents and children who have read Pilkey\'s books together may  appreciate the sheer don\'t-give-a-hoot nerve that the filmmakers have  brought to a project that\'s a thousand kilometers away from being  reputable. They\'ve approached this compendium of elemental slapstick and  unabashed childishness with the reverence that the Coen brothers  brought to ""No Country for Old Men."" The 3-D animation is designed and  executed in an unrealistic manner, paying loving attention to light and  shadow but tossing the laws of physics out of the nearest classroom  window. And whenever you start to feel suffocated by the bright color  and excess of detail, the film will cut to a sequence in a different  style: black-and-white line drawing, mid-century, UPA-style animation,  sock puppetry. ', 'There\'s even a flip book action-scene interlude. As any true ""Captain  Underpants"" fan will tell you, the flip book interludes in Pilkey\'s books are  the best parts. Here, the filmmakers haven\'t just included one, they\'ve gone to the trouble of reproducing the  inevitable moment where the flippers get so excited that they tear the  page. This happened to me more than once while reading the books to my  son when he was small, years ago. It\'s not often that a movie puts a spotlight on a mundane ritual in your own life that you never realized was profound and says, ""You probably forgot about this, but I want you to remember it and savor it, because it meant something."" It happened while watching this ridiculous cartoon. They recaptured it, all of it, down to  the ecstatic pause while the parent fetches Scotch tape to repair a torn page. I  never expected an adaptation of ""Captain Underpants"" to deliver a  version of the madeleine moment in Marcel Proust\'s ""À la recherche du temps perdu."" But here we are.

animation "['Perhaps a loving, joke-filled romp down memory lane, complete with insider references and best-of bits, would be the finest way to immortalize ""The Simpsons"" as it approaches its landmark 300th episode on Sunday. ', 'But no, a jokey tribute wouldn\'t do justice to ""The Simpsons,"" which is -- how to phrase this with the proper amount of gravitas? -- the best television series ever made. Period. ', 'What ""The Simpsons"" has done on the brutal playing field of television is just staggering. It\'s already the longest-running sitcom currently on TV and, having just been renewed for two seasons -- its 15th and 16th -- will surpass ""Ozzie and Harriet"" as the longest-running sitcom in history. ', 'Forget dog years -- TV years are even longer. In this business even hit shows wash out after six or seven years. The standard-bearers in drama -- ""ER"" and ""NYPD Blue"" -- have grown long in the tooth and only periodically rise from their overstayed welcome to give viewers a display of freshness or inspired creativity. ', '""The Simpsons,"" on the other hand, is enjoying one of its finest and funniest seasons in years. It\'s also no stretch to say that producing a sitcom is far more perilous than a drama. ""ER"" can fall back on yet another overturned bus full of children to manipulate the heartstrings of its die-hard fans, but funny is only funny when the audience laughs, and you only have to look at the comedic landscape to see that there are precious few good sitcoms these days. ', 'In fact, most of the longest-running comedies have cheapened themselves and resorted to dramatic elements to stay afloat. Look no further than ""Frasier"" and ""Friends"" for current examples. ""The Simpsons"" has always eschewed sentimentality in favor of caustic, biting humor -- much of it random and pointless and beautifully lacking in any other motive than to make the viewer burst out laughing. ', 'Try that for 14 seasons. Try that and see if your ratings can sustain -- nay, increase -- over the years. ""The Simpsons"" remains one of the top-rated shows on television because, despite off-year dips, it delivers that ever-so- rare ingredient: belly laughs. ', '""The Simpsons"" spans the demographic, too. Nobody loves that more than TV executives. It means that 6-year-olds enjoy the show as much as their parents. It means everyone is invited to the party. You might not get all the jokes in the first go-round, but never fear, a daily repeat is always available. That\'s the glorious benefit of 300 shows in the bank. ', 'To put into perspective the staying power and influence of this series, go back to the beginning, when Fox was a fledgling network and its ""Tracey Ullman Show"" featured what would soon become the most recognized family in America. Two days before Christmas in 1989, ""The Simpsons"" aired as a 30-minute holiday special. The next month it was a regular in the lineup, a powerhouse prime- time cartoon that soon did the unthinkable -- hasten the end of ""The Cosby Show,"" TV\'s most popular series at the time. ', 'Perhaps more daunting was surviving the curse of pop culture celebrity. ""The Simpsons"" landed on countless magazine covers, kids spouted now-trademark lines from the show. You couldn\'t step sideways without bumping into some aspect of the merchandising. Normally, a sensation like that fizzles, either under the weight of its own ubiquitousness or by the newfound disdain and boredom of the populace. ', 'It didn\'t happen, and here we are 14 seasons later, with two more inked, looking at ""The Simpsons"" as one incredibly great television achievement. Along the way the show was taken for granted by fans and critics alike -- ""Of course it\'s brilliant, who can argue that; now, what else is on?"" -- but never supplanted as a staple in our culture, or removed from our viewing habit. If not for ""The Simpsons"" propping up an entire network, who knows what would have happened to Fox? ', 'So, what is the secret ingredient that makes it all work? Not the storied celebrity guest voices, though there have been many. Not the emphasis on irony, ', 'though this country has embraced irony like no other and that fuels nearly every element of popular entertainment. ', 'More likely, it is something as simple as ""The Simpsons"" not growing old as characters. Cartoons don\'t age. No need to constantly tweak the show, as Fox is now doing with another of its comedy hits, ""Malcolm in the Middle."" And, thankfully, the Simpson family -- outside of Lisa on occasion -- didn\'t learn anything either. What\'s more saccharine and comedically disappointing than having some character learn, grow, gain new values? In ""The Simpsons"" milieu, maturation kills comedy. They are still the same inept, befuddled, possibly cursed and flat-out passively dangerous family on the planet. ', 'Homer is Homer. Always will be. Laziness, doughnuts and Duff beer still hold the same appeal they did 14 years ago. Bart is as unrepentantly troublesome as ever. Marge is as understanding now as when we first met her. Lisa is still the heart and soul and intelligence of a family that seeks no greater level of emotional growth than it now has. Maggie keeps sucking away. Springfield is, joyously, just as lousy as ever. ', 'Perhaps creator Matt Groening\'s greatest accomplishment, along with the dedicated writing staffs through the years, was looking beyond the obvious influence of Groening\'s own family and peopling Springfield with enough characters to keep the series as fresh as the day it was conceived (yes, there has been evolution, even in the drawing style and voices since then, but conceptually ""The Simpsons"" has been remarkably consistent). ', 'We have the brilliantly conceived Ralph Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Nelson Muntz, Groundskeeper Willie, the Sea Captain, Milhouse, Otto, Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby -- the list is seemingly endless. Springfield is littered with great characters who are not in the immediate Simpson family. They are vessels for gloriously random jokes that give the episodes depth. Or, if you prefer, were created, like the Sea Captain, for cheap one-liners. ', 'All told, this fictitious family and town, the passers-by, the guests, the outrageous trips, the absurd premises -- each adds value to our lives by visiting every Sunday. Groening and company deserve the utmost praise for envisioning the entire series, making it pay off more often than not over 14 years and finally -- no small feat here -- contributing tangible genius to the medium.

However, he’s actually an incompetent boob who skates out of dangerous situations as a result of pure luck and the help of others. Archer works at ISIS, which is led by his domineering mother, and he makes a mockery of the work place with non-stop sexual flings and neurotic co-workers. ', 'WHAT I LIKED\nLike “The League,” one of FX’s other shows that premiered last year, I never was interested in watching “Archer” during its inaugural broadcast. Cartoons for grown-ups have been very hit-or-miss for me. Sure, you have your big hitters, like “The Simpsons,” “South Park” and “Family Guy,” but there are other attempts that never quite make it. ', 'However, getting a chance to watch the first season of “Archer,” I found it growing on me so much more than the pilot did when I caught it on a previous DVD release (which I think was “The League: Season One” a few months ago). Like any good series, it took some time to really get used to the characters and to stomach the voice of Chris Parnell as one of the characters. But I persevered, and the show has really turned into a clever little series. ', 'The animation is crisp and cool, and I am probably more turned on by the buxom women in the cast than I should be. (Yeah, I’m a little ashamed about that.) But with the “Austin Powers” movies cooling on the DVD shelves, it’s nice to see a punchy, retro, clever and often deliciously inappropriately funny show about spies that doesn’t take itself too seriously. ', 'Archer relies on stereotypes and cliches about the spy film genre to make the jokes work, and it doesn’t pull its punches. Just as “The League” isn’t about fantasy football but rather the shenanigans of the people who play it, “Archer” isn’t a spy show but rather about the shenanigans of people who happen to be spies. ', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nThe first episode or two are a little rough, so if you’re unsure, you should definitely stick with it. By the end of the season, you’ll warm up to the series. ', 'DVD FEATURES\nLike other recent FX DVD releases, the “Archer” set comes with some cross-pollination of the shows. Pilot episodes of “The League” and “Louie” series are included on the two discs. Other features include an unaired network promo, a making-of featurette that covers the technical side of the production, deleted scenes and the most bizarre fever-dream of a n unaired pilot to this series I could have ever imagined.

If you eat at a restaurant whose main selling point is that its towering height or location near a natural wonder affords a feast for the eyes, chances are the food there will fall into the category of a disappointing afterthought.\xa0', 'That can also be the case when it comes to films whose primary attraction is their visual pizzazz. Too often there is a lack of there actually there beyond the wow factor. Consider the gorgeous backdrops of the 1998 Robin Williams-starring afterlife fantasy ""What Dreams May Come"": Looks, 10; story, ugh. “Avatar” might be the ultimate example of this syndrome as its eye-popping 3-D effects only underlined its barely multi-dimensional sci-fi screenplay.', 'Faring slightly better script-wise is the ambitious animated biopic “Loving Vincent.” That would be Vincent as in Van Gogh, the tormented 19th-century Dutch painter, who absorbed the essence of then-popular Impressionism and re-imagined it with his trademark brawny brushstrokes. That technique lent a unique vibrancy to his vividly hued renderings of the French countryside and portraits of acquaintances that are highlighted in the film. As a result, his output seems to be uniquely suited for what is being sold as the first-ever fully painted feature film. This rather melancholy if stiff account of the artist’s final weeks before he died in 1890 from what he claimed was a self-inflicted gunshot is neither consistently riveting nor all that original. But the movie at least benefits somewhat from focusing on this singular tragic soul—yes, Van Gogh is shown famously cutting off his left ear—whose work continues to fascinate us today.', 'What is faultless, however, is the dedication and ambition of Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, the movie-making team behind this Polish-U.K. collaboration. Consider that this production required the services of 125 painting animators to create 65,000 oil-painted frames that incorporated 120 of Van Gogh’s better-known works–a process that took ten years to complete. If you ever wanted a masterpiece hanging in a gallery to come to life, your wish has been fully granted many times over.', 'Their visual experiment is intensely mesmerizing to watch as Van Gogh’s familiar stars radiate in the nighttime skies, flickering halos hover around candles, a river pulses with shimmery waves, rain falls like\xa0strips of\xa0rectangular confetti in shades of black and gray and golden wheat waltzes in fields. Bursts of kinetic energy vibrate in nearly every scene as if the screen were radioactive. But this electric surge is more than just window dressing. It captures the very reason why Van Gogh, whose genius was mostly unsung during his brief life, is\xa0often\xa0considered\xa0the father\xa0of modern art. A social misfit prone to bouts of depression, Van Gogh would devote the last decade of his 37 years to answering his calling. The result was over 800 oil paintings that bared his emotions in a way that offered a portal\xa0into the next century and continues to speak to us today.\xa0', 'But movies can’t live by beautiful undulating images alone. “Loving Vincent” takes the form of a mirthless murder mystery that integrates Van Gogh’s portraits and landscapes with hand-painted live-action footage of actors. This derivative detective story probes whether Van Gogh committed suicide or was shot by someone else. Assuming the role of investigator and narrator is Armand Roulin (Douglas Booth), a bitter young man in a canary-yellow jacket who has a weakness for alcohol and barroom brawls. A year after the artist’s death, he is reluctantly tasked by his postmaster father (Chris O’Dowd) to deliver Vincent’s final letter addressed to his beloved younger brother, Theo. Armand heads to Paris, where he learns from noted paint supplier Pere Tanguy (John Sessions) that Theo met his own demise months after his sibling died. The elder man also fills him in on the history of Vincent’s transformation from an unemployable failure to a prolific producer of fine art.', 'From this point on, “Loving Vincent” follows the well-worn path of many a TV and film sleuth. With newfound respect for and curiosity about Van Gogh, Armand takes off to picturesque Auvers-sur-Oise and begins to interrogate those who knew Vincent during his last six weeks. That includes an innkeeper’s spirited daughter, Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), who has mostly kind things to say about Vincent’s time as a guest, and the less-generous Louise Chevalier (Helen McCrory), housekeeper to Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), the physician who treated him. A religious woman, she demonizes Vincent, declaring, “He was evil.” Then there is Gachet’s daughter, Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan), who may or may not have been romantically connected to Van Gogh. Each witness offers widely divergent opinions of\xa0the artist\xa0before he died. Not helping matters is that the gun involved was never found. Ultimately, viewers are left to form their own conclusions about what happened.', 'Style definitely trumps substance here, as most of the actors are better defined through their vocal performances rather than their shape-shifting physical presences. Van Gogh himself shows up primarily in moody black-and-white\xa0photographic-like\xa0flashbacks told from his point of view as played by look-alike Polish theater actor Robert Gulaczyk. In fact, my favorite scene involves a smiling little girl at the inn running to Vincent and briefly sitting in his lap as he sketches a chicken with skinny legs—just like hers, he teases. In those few minutes, he is momentarily at peace and smiling for once.\xa0Helping to set the right melancholy mood is a superb score by Clint Mansell,\xa0propelled by strings and piano.', 'Only a fool would fail to use a version of Don McLean’s ode to the artist, “Starry Starry Night,” to conclude “Loving Vincent” and, in this case, Kobiela and Welchman do exactly that.

Perhaps burdened by an excess of respect for Paddington Bear’s creator, the children’s author Michael Bond, or maybe just unwilling to deter the built-in market for the inevitable movie-related merchandising, the filmmakers have settled on safe.', 'While going by the books (more than 20 of them since 1958) might reassure their many fans, it’s a disappointingly fainthearted approach to a character who is anything but. Arriving in London as a stowaway from Peru — where a long-ago explorer taught his family to love marmalade and the King’s English — Paddington (voiced by Ben Whishaw) is warily embraced by the Brown family. Mrs. Brown (Sally Hawkins, decked out in amusing hats and old-lady knitwear) looks at him as she might the baby Jesus, but Mr. Brown (Hugh Bonneville, doing his best “Downton Abbey” huffy voice) regards him mainly as an insurance risk. Their two children, like most of the supporting cast, barely register as more than superficial cameos.', 'Despite the kid-gloves sensibility, “Paddington” delivers a knockout blend of fluid animation and live action. Erik Wilson’s primary-colored photography zings, painting an ultra-British, storybook city with a serenely vintage feel. (All the nonwhites — except for some Caribbean musicians — seem to be in hiding.) Stringing together a series of mild, bear-in-a-china-shop misadventures, the director, Paul King (who wrote the story with Hamish McColl), honors the books’ gentle spirit with whimsical humor and a genuine sweetness that little ones should respond to.', 'But the film’s emotions are so carefully calculated that Mr. Brown’s transformation from fuddy-duddy to free spirit — and his sticky kumbaya speech at the end — fail to convince. (Even the lone homoerotic joke feels programmed.) And, as the perfect metaphor for the trials of immigrant assimilation, Paddington could have been given more sophisticated and high-stakes adventures without alienating younger viewers: I doubt that the biggest problem facing British immigrants today is how to negotiate indoor plumbing.', 'At the same time, what tykes will make of Nicole Kidman, playing an evil taxidermist loaded for bear, is anyone’s guess. Squished into a white outfit and stacked on towering heels like a nurse in a bondage video, Ms. Kidman seems more a bone thrown to teenage boys than the antagonist in a children’s movie.

Treacly, kissy-kissy endings are not enough anymore. Nowadays, a princess has to show her mettle and earn her happily-ever-after stripes.', 'Allegorically, “Frozen” lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like “Beauty and the Beast,” but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film. There are moments when you may feel that you are inside a giant crystal chandelier frosted with diamonds.', 'It all takes place in the fictional Scandinavian land of Arendelle, whose king and queen die in a shipwreck, leaving the country in the hands of Elsa (the voice of Idina Menzel), the elder of two daughters. This blond, high-strung princess has a secret problem. If she isn’t extremely careful, everything around her freezes when she takes off her protective gloves and waves her hands. Elsa’s best friend is her impulsive redheaded younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), whom she nearly freezes to death by accident.', 'The sisters become estranged when Anna falls in love at first sight with Hans (Santino Fontana), a too-good-to-be-true prince from a neighboring kingdom, and Elsa forbids them to marry. With one wave of Elsa’s hand, eternal winter descends on Arendelle. She is so horrified by her destructive gift that she retreats to a remote ice palace atop a mountain.', 'As Arendelle suffers through the deep freeze, the resourceful Anna, who still loves her sister, is determined to track down Elsa, who she believes can reverse the spell. Thus begin Anna’s adventures in mountain climbing. Along the way, she meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), a rugged ice dealer who guides a reindeer-driven sleigh. During their “Wizard of Oz”-like quest, they are joined by Olaf (Josh Gad), that sweet, wisecracking snowman.', '“Frozen,” for all its innovations, is not fundamentally revolutionary. Its animated characters are the same familiar, blank-faced, big-eyed storybook figures. But they are a little more psychologically complex than their Disney forerunners. Its princesses may gaze at a glass ceiling, but most are not ready to shatter it.', 'Is it significant that Jennifer Lee, who directed “Frozen” with Chris Buck, is billed as the first female director of a Disney animated feature film? Perhaps. Ms. Lee is credited as the screenwriter of a story that she and Mr. Buck developed with Shane Morris. That screenplay cautiously incorporates some slangy contemporary argot, but its tone is never desperately hip in the manner of the “Shrek” movies. Most of what fun there is revolves around Olaf, a classic Disney sidekick.', 'If “Frozen” still has one foot planted in 19th-century children’s literature, good and evil are not so clear-cut. The title character of the original fairy tale was evil. Her 21st-century descendant is merely confused and scared. As always, love is the solution to everything. When nothing can thaw the icy heart of the frightened Elsa, love does the trick, but in this case it is sisterly loyalty and devotion rather than romantic attachment.', '“Frozen” has eight original songs by the married team of Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, musical theater veterans whose blend of playful wit and sentimentality here comes closer than any score for a Disney animated film to capturing the charm of the Alan Menken-Howard Ashman collaboration in its glory days. One song, “Fixer Upper,” sung by a bunch of trolls promoting the charms of an imperfect eligible bachelor to a picky princess, is genuinely amusing:', 'It can’t be accidental that “Frozen,” with its two female leads, one voiced by the original Elphaba in “Wicked” (Ms. Menzel), has a lot in common with that Broadway juggernaut and seems ready-made for theatrical adaptation.

The only unhappy troll is Branch (the voice of, in a remarkable coincidence, Justin Timberlake: Runner Runner, Inside Llewyn Davis), a sort of extreme survivalist who is camou-colored, and has planned and stockpiled for the day when the Bergens come to eat them all (he has a bunker).

For this reason, it is difficult to see them as villains, because eating these trolls sounds like a good way to get rid of them, and if they literally poop cupcakes, they must taste incredibly delicious. And damned if Poppy’s plan doesn’t involve surreptitiously helping the awful Bergen King Gristle (the voice of Christopher Mintz-Plasse: Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, How to Train Your Dragon 2) find another way to be happy! The movie’s chipper embrace of its bad guys as just poor misunderstood souls even as we cynical adults in the audience are thinking they’re really not so bad after all makes it tough to hate this movie.

That became especially obvious in the spin-off vehicle “Minions” (2015), a film that did little other than illustrate to youngsters the notion of there being too much of a good thing. Now comes “Despicable Me 3,” a depressingly rote piece of corporate product that has so little on its mind other than presumably making hundreds of millions of dollars that you half expect the ticket sellers to hand out copies of Comcast’s latest earnings report along with the 3-D glasses.', 'Having been inspired by his three adorable adopted daughters—Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Grier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel)—to give up a life of super-villainy, Gru (Steve Carrell) is working as an agent for the Anti-Villainy League alongside new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig). As the film opens, the two try to stop the fiendish Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a former kid star from the 80’s seeking revenge on the world for cancelling his TV show (“Evil Bratt”), from stealing the world’s largest diamond with the aid of a robot sidekick, scientifically enhanced bubble gum and a keytar capable of playing the most familiar musical riffs of his favorite era. Although he saves the diamond, Gru lets Balthazar get away and as a result, the new head of the AVL (Jenny Slate in a strangely brief role) fires both him and Lucy. No sooner has Gru suffered this professional setback than his personal world is rocked as well when he is contacted by his heretofore-unknown twin brother Dru (also Carrell) and invited to meet him at his home on the faraway land of Freedonia. (If the name “Freedonia” rings any bells with you, consider that a potential signal that you might be just a little too old for this film.)', 'Gru and the family fly off to Freedonia and discover that Dru is fabulously wealthy and handsome. But just as the even-more-depressed Gru is about to leave, Dru confesses the real reason for summoning his brother—he wants his sibling to teach him the tricks of the super-villain trade so that he can also carry on in the family tradition. Gru refuses at first but since Balthazar has managed to steal that diamond in the interim, he figures that if he can break into Bratt’s lair—an isolated compound topped by a giant Rubik’s Cube—and steal it back, he and Lucy will be reinstated in the AVL. While the two brothers bond and plan their heist—complicated slightly by Dru’s incompetency at even the rudiments of being a villain—the others have their own mini-adventures as well—Lucy struggles to find her way into her new role as the mother to Gru’s daughters, little Agnes becomes obsessed with the notion of finding and adopting her very own unicorn and 12-year-old Margo, in an especially weird turn, takes pity on a boy during a weird cheese-related dance ritual and apparently finds herself engaged to him as a result. As for the Minions, they all abandon Gru early on when he refuses to return to being a villain after getting fired and go on a series of misadventures that land them in prison and on a televised talent show, where they perform what is easily the strangest version of the Gilbert & Sullivan show-stopper “I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General” to turn up in a movie since the release of “The Pirate Movie.”', 'Although the “Despicable Me” movies have tried to appeal to viewers of all ages, they are aimed primarily at the younger set—how else to explain the presence of two fart jokes in the opening title card? The problem here is that the filmmakers seem to have gone out of their way to concoct a story out of elements that will hold little appeal to that target audience. It is highly doubtful they will care about Gru’s worries about the loss of his job, his attempts to bond with his long-lost brother, Lucy’s attempts to be a good mom or Margo’s accidental engagement. Moreover, the whole Balthazar character is liable to baffle and confuse them more than anything else since he is a joke inspired by popular culture trends of an era long before they were even born. Meanwhile, their beloved Minions are so disconnected from the main proceedings that they could have been eliminated entirely from the film without affecting things in the slightest. Perhaps the producers were trying to skew a little older on the basis that the kids who embraced the original film are themselves older and more sophisticated. My guess is that if those particular viewers are going to the movies this weekend, they would be more inclined to try to slip into “Baby Driver” and leave this for their younger siblings.', 'For most of the people involved with the film, “Despicable Me 3” is a payday pure and simple and have responded accordingly. Carrell’s Gru, who seems to consist of equal parts Bela Lugosi and Tommy Wiseau, is still an amusing character but he doesn’t do anything new or interesting in his secondary turn as Dru. The other regulars show up and do their thing while regular supporting players like Julie Andrews and Steve Coogan appear just long enough to ensure future residual checks before disappearing entirely. (Apparently they couldn’t get Russell Brand back into the fold, though the way out that has been devised is kind of funny.) As for Trey Parker’s work as Balthazar, it is more disconcerting than anything else because whenever you hear his voice, you half expect him to go into full “South Park” mode, a move that would have left the PG rating in the dust but which certainly might have perked things up a bit.', 'Of course, all of these criticisms are fairly academic since “Despicable Me 3” is basically the closest thing to a sure thing at the box office, even in a season when most of the would-be sure things have been crapping out to one degree or another. Despite the problematic storytelling, little kids will probably still like it because it is colorful and noisy and filled with silly slapstick, though my bet is that they won’t embrace it to the degree that they did the original. As for parents and guardians charged with accompanying the tykes, it will keep the kids occupied for 90 minutes and they can at least enjoy the 80s-era hits on the soundtrack (with the Madonna classic “Into the Groove” getting the best play of the bunch) while waiting out the clock. Besides, it isn’t as if it will linger in their minds for too long since the whole enterprise is even more instantly forgettable than “Despicable Me 2,” which may be its only real accomplishment. \xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

The streaming service branched out into talk shows with Chelsea, dominated scripted programming with Stranger Things and countless other shows, and basically cornered the stand-up comedy market. Yet one push went, for the most part, unnoticed: their foray into the world of anime. Now in 2018, adding to Netflix’s growing library of exclusive content comes the first of many planned anime series, DEVILMAN crybaby.', 'Based on the legendary Devilman manga books by artist Go Nagai, this new 10 episode show is sure to delight any fan of the genre. The story follows Akira Fudo (Kouki Uchiyama) who discovers that an ancient race of demons has returned to take back the world from humans. The only way to defeat the demons is to incorporate their supernatural powers, and Akira himself bonds with one. He succeeds in transforming into Devilman, who possesses both the powers of a demon and the soul of a human.', 'The first season is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, know for the 2004 anime film Mind Game, which holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Based on the early looks we’ve seen, we can definitely expect plenty of wild visuals. Start your year off right with a quick binge.\xa0DEVILMAN crybaby isn’t just for the Japanese!

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', '“Cars” and “Cars 2,” are outliers in Pixar’s lineup of critically acclaimed, family friendly blockbusters: the original made a fortune despite poor reviews, and the sequel made another fortune despite even worse reviews. A sort-of spin-off, “Planes”—which is not part of the extended Carsoverse, but was released by Pixar\'s parent company, Disney—got pounded like a piñata by reviewers, but it made so much loot that Pixar churned out a sequel, “Planes: Fire & Rescue,” one year later. And at no point in this timeline of movies about anthropomorphic vehicles did Pixar, a company that’s gone to great lengths to convince us that it never does things just for the money, seem to lose sleep over the prospect that we’d think they that\'s exactly why they were making more ""Cars"" and ""Planes"" films.', 'Lo and behold: here’s “Cars 3,” a smiley-faced Frankenstein’s monster comprised of bits and pieces lifted from every other sports film in existence. The screenplay rips off the main plot of the Tom Cruise racing picture “Days of Thunder” (knowingly, though; a supporting race car character is cleverly named “Cruz”) and merges it with bits of “Rocky III,” the one where the champ went soft and had to find his edge again; “Rocky IV,” where the champ had to train in snowy Siberian woods to fend off a challenger who relied on steroids and fancy machines, and “Creed,” where the champ realized that passing wisdom on to the next generation can be as satisfying as acquiring it when you’re young. There is, at the level of plot and characterization, not a single major element in this movie that you haven’t seen elsewhere, possibly in a “Cars” or “Planes” film. Despite its lack of originality, as well as its lackadaisical storytelling and world building, it satisfies in that amiably weird way that only a ""Cars"" film can.', ' Champion race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been on top for so long that he has failed to notice that he’s not getting any younger. He’s challenged by a snotty, bullying wannabe-champ, Jackson Storm (Armie Hammer), a super-high tech car that can go 200 m.p.h. without breaking a—well, cars don’t sweat, but you get the idea. Following a disastrous defeat by Storm, Lightning lets his sponsor Sterling (Nathan Fillion) talk him into training in an elaborate racing simulation facility under a younger trainer, Cruz Ramirez (Cristela Alonzo), who excitedly but thoughtlessly describes him as “my senior project.” When Lighting wipes out there, too, Sterling informs him that he’s mainly interested in using a retired Lightning as a pitchman for Rust-eze mud flaps. This leads the former champ to return to his roots in the rural holler where his late mentor Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, playing “himself” via outtakes and a celebrity impersonator) learned skills and tricks that he passed down to Lightning. And it’s here that ""Rocky IV"" rears its meaty head, with a montage that contrasts Lightning and Cruz driving through woods and around dirt tracks against shots of Storm training in an indoor facility that looks like a place where a Bond villain might throw a Christmas party.', 'It’s not a spoiler to say that this film has a happy ending, but to its credit, for all its clichés, it doesn’t give us the ending we expect. The Doc-Lightning and Lightning-Cruz relationships suggest a passing of the torch, and “Cars 3” finds a decent way to give us that, along with a sub-theme of female empowerment and a sincere belief in the idea that privileges have to be given up or amended if society, even a car-centric one, is going to keep evolving.', 'The film hedges its bets here, though, as if it’s trying to avoid a boycott led by the sorts of men who buy tickets to women-only screenings of “Wonder Woman” and think they’re striking a blow for civil rights. And the notion of a gendered car universe that grapples with sexism is discombobulating because the film mostly dances around the issue without mustering the nerve or the chops to properly deal with it.\xa0(When Lightning repeatedly diminishes Cruz as “a trainer” rather than “a racer,” it sounds like he’s trying to put a female car in her place, and when Storm taunts Cruz, his insults evoke a male nerd taunting a female one for not being a ""true"" fan of the thing they both love.) ', 'The notion of automotive gender and discrimination issues is not something the series ever tackled before; likewise the implication of a car caste system, where you\'re born into a particular automotive body and that defines the rest of your life, however long that is. Of course, this is a series in which cars can have baby cars, and there are car insects (or insect cars?), and in the second movie there are living planes, presumably to transport the cars long distances, inside of their bodies. And the tractors in these movies are coded as ""cattle,"" which I guess are eaten by the other cars.\xa0 ', 'This sort of awkwardness is common in the worlds of “Cars” and “Planes."" The films draw jokey inspiration from the human world in ways that amuse in the moment but seem weirdly chilling when you think about them later. As many “Cars” and “Planes” obsessives have pointed out, dialogue and subplots in both and “Cars” and “Cars 2” suggest that this world once included humans, which raises the prospect of a “Terminator”- or “Maximum Overdrive”-like machine rebellion. A joke in the first “Cars” referencing Jimi Hendrix makes us wonder if there was an actual Hendrix in the “Cars” world and if so, what happened to him. If there are no humans, why do the cars have door handles? The acknowledgement of World War II in “Planes” raises the question of whether there was a car Hitler, a car Hiroshima, and so on. Likewise, the rural Southern caricatures (many of these cars have bad teeth!) imply that geographical distinctions between the American North and South in our world hold true here as well, which in turns could mean there was a Civil War that pitted car against car, and that their descendants still argue over whether the war was about slavery or state’s rights. (For a primer on these conundrums, see this article by Matt Singer, the Ptolemy of “Cars” studies; you can follow it up with this piece suggesting that “Cars 3” is a self-aware meditation on Pixar’s own collective fear of aging and irrelevance.)  ', 'As examples of imaginative commercial filmmaking, the “Cars” films range from mediocre to coldly impressive. The landscapes are photo-realistically convincing, the animators work small miracles making the cars seem lifelike and expressive, and the action sequences are stunning examples of how to deliver a lot of information quickly without confusing the audience. But as pieces of storytelling, the films are borderline inept by the standards of Pixar, a rare studio that exercises auteur-like control over every frame of every project they release.', 'And yet, against all odds, there is magic in these films; it just doesn’t have much to do with their excellence as, well, films. That’s a bummer for cinephiles but irrelevant to people seeking a movie filled with broad jokes, flashy action and canned moral lessons that will keep kids occupied for a couple of hours. In the end, it’s more fun to talk about the moon-sized logical loopholes in the “Cars” universe than it is to watch a “Cars” movie. I don’t know if that’s OK, but it’s something. At their best, these movies capture the sense of heedless, goofy play that consumed us when we were little. When I was a kid I used to make my Hot Wheels cars fight each other, using their front wheels as fists. Maybe Pixar can work a scene like that into “Cars 4.”\xa0', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

No messing around— the Mouse people knew what they were doing. This was a property that they had plans for. There would be no languishing for years after purchase (hello, DreamWorks and your various questionable acquisitions). It seemed like only moments had passed before Disney announced their intent of reviving the Star Wars film series, and we all knew that other merchandising would be hitting fast and heavy. With the films a given, and toys a must, one big question was the fate of the franchise on television. The beloved Clone Wars show had run for five seasons on Cartoon Network already, with a sixth season ending up on Netflix and home video once Disney took over. Further episodes were in question, depending on how Disney wished to proceed; but even aside from Disney’s wishes, Clone Wars had had a lot of input and direction from George Lucas, and the Clone Wars production staff had mixed feelings about continuing without Lucas anyway.', 'And thus Clone Wars came to a close. Lucasfilm Animation was given a new mandate, which they gladly took on: create a show that bridges the two film trilogies. The result is Star Wars: Rebels, set fourteen years after Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith, and five years prior to Episode IV: A New Hope (known to many of us old-timers as simply Star Wars).', 'The Empire is now fully in charge. The joy that accompanied the end of the Clone Wars has been replaced with something else. To many, there is little doubt that the Empire is a fascist outfit led by a supreme dictator, using thug-like tactics and propaganda to stay in charge of countless star systems. The people living in these systems have begun to both grow weary of their oppressors, and scared for their lives should they not cooperate with the authorities. There is a growing sense that something must be done, but those in the main planetary centers are relatively powerless in the face of their oppressors. Yet, on the outer rim of the galaxy, the Empire’s hold is somewhat more tenuous, and even though those residents may not feel the full presence of the Empire, it is in these secluded regions where rebellion may be most likely to start.', 'Rebels premiered on the Disney Channel initially in October 2014, before moving to Disney XD. The pilot was first shown as a one-hour special, called Spark Of Rebellion', 'Even just during Spark Of Rebellion, many familiar sights are seen, with many poor-aiming Stormtroopers, various ships, and of course the Wookies (even if they are poorly rendered, showing the limitations of the show’s CGI). Even Darth Vader is glimpsed. In the following episode, Droids In Distress, we also get reacquainted with R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, naturally), who are initially in conflict with the Rebels, until things are sorted out in the end. ', 'Right from the start, Ezra is in conflict with fellow rebel Zeb, a hulking somewhat cat-like being, but anyone can see they will eventually form a brotherly friendship. That comes to fruition in Fighter Flight, when they steal a TIE fighter together. Then, Ezra’s relationship with Kanan is furthered in Rise Of The Old Masters, as they attempt to rescue a Jedi master but run into the Jedi hunter known as The Inquisitor. Ezra then goes undercover on his own at an Imperial academy in the exciting  Breaking Ranks. ', 'Then, Out Of Darkness throws the spotlight on the two female members of the crew. Hera is the pilot of the Ghost, and the one most closely associated with the mysterious Fulcrum, a person who provides guidance for the rebel forces. This rankles the Mandalorian girl named Sabine, whose stubborn and controlling nature makes it difficult for her to trust anyone who isn’t fully in her sights. The two women have to band together in order to survive a perilous trip to another planet, where lethal creatures threaten their lives.', 'The mystery behind the disappearance of Ezra’s parents is the focus of Gathering Forces, but Ezra and Kanan once again come into conflict with The Inquisitor, and Ezra learns of the power of the Dark Side from personal experience. This scary moment leads to Kanan taking Ezra to a Jedi temple on Lothal in Path Of The Jedi, in order to learn more about the Force and what it means to be a Jedi. Frank Oz guests as the voice of Yoda in this episode. Another familiar voice is featured in Idiot’s Array, when Billy Dee Williams joins the cast as Lando Calrissian. This is apparently after Lando has already lost the Millennium Falcon, and he connives a way of having the Ghost crew help him to acquire some illegal cargo, with Hera as the bait. Meanwhile, Lando also holds ownership of the crew’s temperamental droid Chopper, whom Lando has won in a card game with an embarrassed Zeb.', 'The world of our Rebels is broadened further when they meet the fugitive-in-hiding Senator Gall Trayvis in Vision Of Hope. What they learn in that episode inspires the Rebels to craft a bold mission that will see them take over an Imperial communications array on Lothal in Call To Action. It is their hope to contact other worlds in order to inspire other rebels to fight the Empire. Unfortunately, they have also attracted the attention of Grand Moff Tarkin, who personally comes to Lothal to take over the Imperial operations there and capture the rebels. Tarkin downplays the reports of there being a Jedi on Lothal, but he is eager to meet the much-rumored adversary.', 'Indeed, the entire first season of Rebels seems like a prologue to the show we have really been waiting for. Over the course of the season, we are introduced to the Ghost crew, and see in microcosm how the Empire has affected the galaxy. I certainly felt that the series was extremely confined and small in scale, compared to what he experienced in Clone Wars, but I had faith that co-executive producer Dave Filoni (who also ran Clone Wars) and his own crew would eventually get around to bringing us the full origin of the Rebellion. Season One is just about putting the pieces in place, before all heck breaks loose in Season Two. There is no doubt at the conclusion of Fire Across The Galaxy that the series is about to gain greatly in scope, as more old faces return, questions are raised about the end of the Clone Wars, and new allies are found.', 'The opening season of Rebels was always intended as an introduction, so the scale remains less than epic for most of this season. You may yearn for something greater, but there is always a sense that patience shall be rewarded. In the meantime, every episode has value in terms of character development, exciting action, and numerous cool moments that will delight any Star Wars fan. Those that didn’t care for the look of Clone Wars may like Rebels even less, given that so much of the action takes place on barren Lothal, limiting the amount of eye candy on display. It also seems that old lessons may need to be relearned in terms of the animation. The hairy Wookies look terrible, given the show’s style of having all hair move as a single chunk. And some characters, Lando in particular, are over-animated to the point of looking painfully like buffoonish puppets; this sadly undermines Williams’ oh-so-smooth delivery of his lines. On the other hand, when facial expressions are under-animated, the characters’ acting is severely compromised. I thought that Clone Wars became much better with its animation during its run, so I’m a little puzzled as to why this show seems to be starting at the beginning of the learning curve again. Nevertheless, the show remains fun and thrilling.', 'This Blu-ray set excels with its supplemental features. Each episode gets a Rebel Recon segment lasting about five minutes. In those few minutes, the episode is recapped before several interview segments are hosted by Star Wars social media correspondent Andi Gutierrez. Here, she discusses the series’ direction with Dave Filoni, she asks questions of Lucasfilm executive and Star Wars lore-master Pablo Hidalgo, and also talks to various other members of the production staff. Each of these segments is a great companion to its respective episode.', 'Rebels Infiltrates Star Wars Celebration (4:03) is a nice look at how the show has already impacted the annual Star Wars convention. We see footage of the Rebels panel, interviews with production staff and voice actors, and some great cosplay.', 'Star Wars Rebels: The Ultimate Guide (22:05) is a rundown of the whole first season, hosted by Kanan, voiced here as usual by Freddie Prinze, Jr. You know, I had never really valued Prinze as an actor (Scooby-Doo having scarred me), but he does a great job at bringing all the proper nuances to Kanan. This featurette, though, is pretty skippable, as it is just a quick tour of everything you have just viewed. It could be a great primer, though, just before you head into Season Two, if it’s been a while since you’ve seen the episodes, or if you’re helping a friend catch up.', 'Rebels Season Two: A Look Ahead (7:06) is a cruel, wonderfully exciting suggestion of what awaits us in the coming season. Aside from tantalizing hints from Filoni, we also get to see some snazzy concept art.', 'Before the series premiered, there were four RebelsShorts, each lasting about three minutes, that were shown on television and online. Each focuses on a different crew member, prior to Ezra joining the crew. They are presented here in the bonus material, though they could certainly be viewed first.', 'This region-free release comes in a standard Blu-ray case, with a Blu-ray disc on each side. There are inserts for Disney Movie Rewards and the Disney Movie Club. The cover slip has some nice embossing. ', 'This series is shown on television in a 16:9 ratio, and that is how it appears in this release, breaking with the format of the Star Wars: Clone Wars series, which nicely utilized the 2.35:1 ratio to match the Scope-formatted films. Aside from any budgetary imitations, this show looks great on Blu-ray, perfectly capturing all the action and color of the series. Though humans don’t generally come off all that great in how they are animated, the Stormtroopers are often photo-realistic, and the few space shots we get do look epic.', 'English, French, Spanish, and German speakers each get Dolby Digital 5.1 tracks. That’s right, no lossless sound on this release, which is sure to disappoint many, but is in keeping with what we always got with Clone Wars on Blu-ray. As such, despite the fun sound design, including use of several sound effects from the film library, the sound is never all that it could be. Still, there is some nice bass, and attention is given to having the surrounds pitch in during battles in particular, but also with ambient sounds.', 'Subtitles are available in English (SDH), French, and Spanish, and there are English captions as well.', 'This is not yet the show that fans are dreaming of, but the pieces are in place. Given how wonderful that Clone Wars turned out, I have little doubt that the same will happen for Star Wars – Rebels. We have an engaging cast, including a type of Jedi we have not seen before; and a few mysteries have been set up, not to mention a huge set-up for the second season, which promises to up the stakes in a big hurry. The bonus features on this set make it a strong recommend even if you have already caught the show on TV.', '\n\nYou may be interested in these related articles:\n Star Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\nLego Star Wars – The Freemaker Adventures: Complete Season One\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars – A Galaxy Divided\n\n\n\n', 'You may be interested in these related articles:\n Star Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\nLego Star Wars – The Freemaker Adventures: Complete Season One\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars – A Galaxy Divided\n\n\n', '\n Star Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\nLego Star Wars – The Freemaker Adventures: Complete Season One\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars – A Galaxy Divided\n\n\n', '\nHow would you rate it?\n \xa0 5.75/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n', '\n \xa0 5.75/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n']" "[' Animation', ' Action', ' Adventure', ' Sci-Fi']" "Star Wars: Rebels"

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Since “Toy Story” became an enormous box-office hit and a beloved modern masterpiece by giving audiences an inspired look at what ordinary toys do when their owners aren’t around, Hollywood has been striving to repeat that seemingly simple formula with a number of animated films that have offered viewers a privileged glimpse at the heretofore unseen existence of everything from the shelves of a grocery store (the execrable “Foodfight!”) to the psyche of a young girl (the stunning “Inside Out”). Now comes “The Emoji Movie,” a film that dares to ask “What goes on in the magical worlds contained within our cell phones?,” a notion that I do not think that anyone has ever pondered for any amount of time outside of those stuck in a focus group at Sony Animation. That is only the first of many problems with this film, a work so completely devoid of wit, style, intelligence or basic entertainment value that it makes that movie based on the Angry Birds app seem like a pure artistic statement by comparison.', 'The extremely dubious conceit of ""The Emoji Movie"" is that hidden within the messaging app in our phones is a teeming metropolis known as Textopolis, where all of the emojis live and wait to be called upon by their owners to say what mere words cannot. All emojis are supposed to have only one facial expression but Gene (T.J. Miller), who is supposed to be a “meh” like his parents (Steven Wright and Jennifer Coolidge), is just so darn exuberant that he is unable to stick with just one expression. This becomes a problem when his phone’s owner, a 14-year-old boy named Alex struggling to reach out to the girl that he likes, selects Gene for a text he is sending to her—Gene chokes at the last second and coughs up so many expressions that it is impossible to understand what he is supposed to represent. Discovering his secret and fearing what it could mean for everyone if one emoji seems to be malfunctioning, Smiler (Maya Rudolph), the always-grinning leader of Textopolis, decides to have Gene wiped out for good.\xa0', 'Gene manages to escape Smiler’s clutches and with the help of another outcast emoji, the once-popular Hi-5 (James Corden), he hits upon a plan to have himself reprogrammed to show only one expression so that he can finally fit in. The only emoji who can do this for him is master hacker Jailbreak (Anna Faris), who agrees to help him if he will come with her on a journey to the fabled Cloud, where his ability to change expressions could help her get past the impenetrable firewall protecting it. Their journey across the phone takes the three to a number of different apps and along the way, they learn valuable lessons about Being Yourself and Friendship and the like while being pursued by Smiler’s troops, who have all been outfitted with illegal upgrades to make them extra-powerful. To make matters worse, Alex, having grown increasingly annoyed by the glitches inadvertently caused by Gene’s journey, has made an appointment to have his phone and everything contained within completely erased.', 'So what wonders lie just beneath our touch screens, anyway? Based on the evidence put forth by “The Emoji Movie,” it is a combination of product placement and corporate synergy. Textopolis itself is an indifferently conceived and executed cityscape populated by any number of familiar emojis, the most famous of which is presumably Poop, who is voiced by none other than Sir Patrick Stewart in one of his less dignified gigs. Once we get outside the walls of Textopolis, we are essentially placed into a series of mini-ads for well-known apps that range from brief detours to the lands of Facebook and YouTube to extended commercials for the Candy Crush and Just Dance games. Since nothing of import goes on during these scenes (or any others, for that matter), I found myself speculating on which ones spent the most money to appear in the film based on the length of their exposure and the praise that they receive from the characters. Based on the available evidence, Dropbox must have been the big spender here—not only is it the all-important gateway to the Cloud but the characters manage to safely hide out from the bad guys there because, and I quote, “they are illegal malware and this app is secure.” Then again, my guess is that the film could have gone into profit solely from taking money from companies eager to keep their apps as far away from this as possible.', 'The failure of imagination in “The Emoji Movie” is not limited to its depiction of the app world. This is a film that has literally nothing to offer viewers—there are no moments of humor, excitement or insight regarding a culture that considers emojis to be the pinnacle of contemporary communication. The actors go through their lines with such a lack of enthusiasm that they make Krusty the Klown seem focused and committed by comparison. The message about the importance of Being True To Yourself rings exceptionally hollow considering that there is not a single thing here that has not been blatantly taking from other, better films. In fact, the only factor about the screenplay that is remotely surprising is the presence of Mike White, the acclaimed writer of the likes of “School of Rock” and “Beatriz at Dinner,” as one of the credited screenwriters. How to explain his participation in a project as lame as this? My guess is that, as the most powerful and popular emoji of all, the Poop emoji demanded he be brought in to punch up his dialogue.', '“The Emoji Movie” is a demonstration of artistic abdication at its most venal, but will the kids like it? To that question, I offer this observation. This past weekend, I played ersatz uncle by taking two adorable girls of my acquaintance—10-year-old Mamie and 4-year-old Danger (actually, that is her middle name and I swear I am not joking)—to see Hayao Miyazaki’s 1989 favorite “Kiki’s Delivery Service” on the big screen in a nearly-full theater that contained a lot of families with small children. The kids didn’t know they were seeing a masterpiece but were so caught up in the story and the gorgeous visuals that you could hear a pin drop in the auditorium. By comparison, at the screening of “The Emoji Movie” I attended, there were plenty of kids but judging by the shifting in seats, rustling of candy bags and the lack of laughter, they did not seem to be into it at all. “The Emoji Movie” may be as depressing of a film experience as anything to come out this year but if the reaction of the kids that I saw it with is any indication, there may be hope for the future after all.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', '“Mary and the Witch’s Flower,” the first film from Studio Ponoc, an animation outfit founded by Studio Ghibli veterans Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Yoshiaki Nishimura after Ghibli closed its doors in 2015, starts in medias res, with a violent firestorm engulfing the screen. A small girl with bright red hair escapes the maelstrom by flying away on a broomstick, pursued by dolphin-squid-fighter-jet hybrids. She plunges down through the clouds and crashes into a field, where her stolen cargo of glowing blue flowers scatters, instantly transforming the landscape (trees burst out of the earth to towering heights in the blink of an eye). Who she is, where she is, and why she needs to escape isn’t revealed until nearly the end of the film.\xa0', 'After the action-packed prologue, “Mary and the Witch’s Flower” segues into another world entirely. In bucolic England, another red-haired little girl, Mary (Ruby Barnhill, in the English dub version), waits out the final days of summer vacation while staying at the home of her great-aunt Charlotte (Lynda Baron). The only other kid around is a boy named Peter (Louis Ashbourne Serkis), whom Mary takes a disliking to for no apparent reason. One day, she follows a black cat—who appears to be beckoning her on, like the white rabbit in\xa0Alice in Wonderland—into the forest. Deep in the forest, she discovers a twisted tree with a broomstick embedded in its trunk and blue flowers glowing at its roots. Mary picks one of the flowers, and is promptly yanked into the sky by the broomstick, which whisks her—and the cat—to a mysterious colorful city floating in the middle of the clouds. This is Endor College, a school for witches.', 'Headmistress Madame Mumblechook (Kate Winslet) gives the agog Mary a tour of the school and becomes convinced Mary is a prodigy, the likes of which she has never seen. “Red-haired witches have always been supremely superior,” she gushes. Mumblechook brings Mary to see Doctor Dee (Jim Broadbent), a small Lenin look-alike, who scribbles formulae on gigantic blackboards, trying to perfect his hush-hush experiments in transformation. He, too, is impressed by Mary’s promise. All of this unfolds in a pure and almost stately atmosphere of accord and exchanged pleasantries. It’s not until halfway through the film that any conflict arises. Is Endor too good to be true? Well, what do you think?\xa0', '“Mary and the Witch’s Flower” tiptoes into some pretty interesting territory about magic, its proper and improper—even immoral, unethical—uses. Eventually, when Mary goes up against Mumblechook and Dee, she won’t rely on magic to get her through but ingenuity and courage. This is not the expected path for a film about magic; it’s saying, essentially, “You don’t need it. You’ve got everything you need with you already.” I found this aspect of the film tremendously exciting, especially how it plays out in the final third.\xa0', 'The animators invoke worlds upon worlds in “Mary and the Witch’s Flower:” the green woods and mist-filled forests of England rendered in swooning evocative watercolors, and the show-stopping Endor, a psychedelic space from out of a dream or drug trip, packed with strange objects, unexplainable phenomena, students floating by in soap bubbles, fountains morphing into human form, grotesque creatures loping out of the shrubbery and disappearing. Endor is dazzling in an off-putting way (similar to some of the “worlds” presented in “The Congress,” where animated avatars engulf their originals.) The action sequences are intricate and thrilling.\xa0', '“Mary and the Witch’s Flower” is based on\xa0The Little Broomstick, a 1971 children’s novel by popular British author Mary Stewart (who just died in 2014). It’s not hard to picture J.K. Rowling reading\xa0The Little Broomstick\xa0as a child, getting swept away by the story of a regular kid (who’s really not regular at all) attending a boarding school run by witches and warlocks. There’s a lot here reminiscent of other stories, like\xa0Alice in Wonderland,\xa0Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter, as well as other films from the Studio Ghibli canon. Yonebayashi’s Oscar-nominated “When Marnie Was There,” also adapted from a British YA novel published 50 years ago, features a little girl who discovers an abandoned mansion while staying with her relatives in the English countryside. Hayao Miyazaki’s “Kiki’s Delivery Service” comes to mind, too, tracking the adventures of a young witch and her “familiar,” a cat named Jiji. “Mary and the Witch’s Flower” doesn’t feel derivative, but it lacks the depth of these other explorations.\xa0', 'Mary, as a character, is refreshingly unremarkable. She’s a regular kid. She has empathy for animals. She’s got a healthy temper. She takes joy in the simple things. She’s helpful to her great-aunt. She hates her hair. She follows the gardener around asking him questions. She seems like a real child (Barnhill’s performance is excellent). However, there’s nothing\xa0missing\xa0for Mary. There’s no real inner conflict in the character, informing her choices (consciously or unconsciously). She’s unhappy about being too clumsy to help around the house. She’s annoyed by Peter, even though he’s friendly to her. Conflict doesn’t have to be some huge melodramatic thing, but the total lack of inner conflict in Mary might be why “Mary and the Witch’s Flower”—as transportive and entertaining as it is—feels a little slight.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'Fantasy\r\nfilms aimed at kids don’t have to have political messages, but when they do, they\r\nshould either be internally consistent, or work through the contradictions in\r\nterms that kids can apply to the real world. “Zootopia,” a fantasy set in a city\r\nwhere predators and prey live together in harmony, is a funny, beautifully\r\ndesigned kids’ film with a message that it restates at every turn. But if you\r\nthink about that message for longer than five minutes, it doesn’t merely fall\r\napart, it invites a reading that is almost surely contrary to the movie’s\r\nseemingly enlightened spirit: discrimination is wrong, but stereotypes are\r\nstereotypes for a reason, and it’s not easy for members of a despised class to\r\novercome the reasons why the majority despises them, so you gotta be patient.', 'Ginnifer\r\nGoodwin (“Big Love”) voices Bunny Hops, a small town rabbit who’s told that she\r\ncan’t be a police officer in Zootopia because there’s never been a rabbit\r\npolice officer. (The job tends to be done by predators and large\r\nherbivores—like a water buffalo that’s become a police captain, voiced by Idris\r\nElba.) Hops makes it through police training anyway and gets assigned to meter maid duty, to the relief of her carrot\r\nfarmer parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), who gave her fox repellent as a\r\ngoing-away present. They had good reason to give her fox repellent: the fox is\r\none of the rabbit’s mortal enemies, and when Judy was child, a fox cornered her\r\nat a county fair, insulted her for being a bunny, and slashed her face with his\r\npaw. (This is a slightly more intense kid-flick than you might expect, given\r\nhow many adorable animals are in it.) ', 'Of\r\ncourse Hops ends up partnered with a red fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a\r\nsmall-time hustler who reluctantly helps her investigate the\r\ndisappearances of a dozen predators. I won’t reveal exactly what the mystery is\r\nhere (it’s a pretty good one) except to say that it invites kids and parents to\r\ntalk about nature versus nurture, and the origins and debilitating effect of\r\nstereotypes. ', 'But this turns out to be not such a great thing once you get deeper into the movie. Because people are not animals, I dread thinking about the “logical”\r\nconclusions to which such conversations will lead. The film isn’t wrong to say\r\nthat carnivores are biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that\r\nbunnies reproduce prolifically, the sloths are slow-moving (they work at the DMV\r\nhere), that you can take the fox out of the forest but you can’t take forest\r\nout of the fox, and so on. If you think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in (particularly if we live in a melting-pot big city like Zootopia) and and then ask yourself\r\nwhich racial or ethnic or societal groups (cops, businesspeople, city bureaucrats) are “predators” and which are “prey” (for\r\npurposes of metaphor translation), you see the problem. ""Zootopia"" pretty much rubber-stamps whatever worldview parents want to pass on to their kids, however embracing or malignant that may be. I can imagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of this film, each thinking it\r\nvalidated their sense of how the world works.', ' “Zootopia” is constantly asking\r\nits characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist\r\nlanguage or repeat hurtful assumptions. “Only a bunny can call another bunny ‘cute,’”\r\nHops warns a colleague It’s filled with moments that are about overcoming or\r\nenduring discrimination. “Never let them see that they get to you,” Wilde\r\nadvises Hops. And there are acknowledgments of the destructive self-hatred that discrimination can cause. Many of the animals make self-deprecating jokes at the expense of stereotypes about their species (such as Hops volunteering to do math for Wilde, telling him, ""If there\'s one thing we bunnies are good at, it\'s multiplying""), and there\'s a fairly intense flashback which reveals that Wilde became a hustler because other animals hazed him as a pup while repeating anti-fox stereotypes, and responded by embracing his species\' caricature and becoming the foxiest fox anyone had seen. This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat herbivores because it\'s in their nature. (Yes, readers, I know, there are tigers who\'ve been taught to snuggle with lambs, and I\'ve seen the same memes with cats and dogs snuggling that you have; I mean in general.) ', ""It might seem weird that I’m dwelling on this aspect of “Zootopia,” which is directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore and co-directed by Jared Bush, because the movie is\r\nentertaining. The thriller plot, which borrows rather generously from “48 HRS”\r\nand every cop drama involving governmental conspiracy, is smartly\r\nshaped\xa0 It’s hard to imagine any\r\nchild or adult failing to be amused and excited by parts of it. The compositions and lighting are more thoughtful than you tend to get in a 3-D animated film starring big-eyed animals who speak with the voices of celebrities. And there are a few sections that are transportingly lovely, in particular any sequence involving the pop star Gazelle (voiced by Shakira), and Hops' high-speed train ride towards and through Zootopia, which introduces the city's different terrains (including frozen tundra and misty rainforest) while leaving room for subsequent bits of spelunking (a foot chase through rodent town lets Hops know what it feels like to be a giant). Some of the biggest laughs come from obvious gags that you know the writers couldn't resist, such as the bit where Idris' water buffalo captain says they can't start the morning briefing without acknowledging the elephant in the room. If you decide not to think about the metaphor that the film is built around, it's an enjoyable diversion, made with great skill. "", 'Still: is it too much to ask that a film that wears its noble intentions like a jangling neck collar be able to withstand scrutiny? If ""Zootopia"" were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it\'s a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn\'t add up in the way it wants to.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

A sense of displacement from our daily lives, and a search for something that would anchor us to a more commonly perceived sense of normalcy? The Japanese phenomenon “Your Name” (it was the highest grossing film of last year in the country and the highest grossing anime film of all time worldwide, passing ""Spirited Away"") is about this highly relatable sense of looking for something, someone, someplace. And so much more. It’s a beautiful, captivating piece of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an emotional, powerful ending. And you won’t see a better-looking animated film all year.', 'Writer/director Makoto Shinkai takes what could have been a very cheesy “Freaky Friday”-esque concept and imbues it with melancholy and honesty. The set-up is relatively simple: Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) is a high school-age girl who lives in the fictional Itomori, a gorgeous, quaint village in the Hida region of Japan; Taki (Ryunosuke Kamiki)  is a slightly older boy living in Tokyo. They are both average kids with their own social circles, but they have no actual connection, and lead very different lives, at least partially defined by their equally gorgeous settings of city vs. country. ', 'One day, Taki wakes up and looks down to see breasts. He’s in Mitsuha’s body. The next day, Mitsuha wakes up back in her own form but with only vague memories of the day before. And, of course, the same thing happens in reverse. Mostly through discussions with people around them about how weird they were acting, Mitsuha and Taki figure out that they’re switching places randomly, only after sleep. Rather than get into wacky hijinks like an ‘80s Disney movie, they work to help each other, leaving each other notes and diaries about what happened when they switched places. For example, Mitsuha has the courage to talk to the girl Taki likes, serving as a sort of body-switching Cyrano de Bergerac. But one day, they stop switching, and Taki can’t get a hold of Mitsuha in any way. He has vague memories of vistas from Mitsuha’s life and he sets out to try to find her. This is when “Your Name” becomes something very unexpected.', 'To say that “Your Name” is visually striking would be a giant understatement. Shinkai and his team have both an eye for detail and a poetic vision. The settings of “Your Name” somehow feel both lived-in and magical at the same time. Whether it’s the train system in Tokyo, its gorgeous skyscrapers touching the sky, a never-ending horizon in Itomori, or even just a series of streets on a mountainside, “Your Name” is one of those animated films in which one could pick any still frame from it and hang it on their wall. And yet the gorgeous visuals of the film never stifle the storytelling; they’re intertwined with one another. “Your Name” seems to often be saying: city or country, it’s a beautiful world out there and we only need to find our place in it.', 'Shinkai avoids so many potential narrative pitfalls (that it feels like the inevitable live-action remake will tumble into willingly). For one, Mitsuha and Taki maintain gender differences without feeling clichéd in the boy vs. girl way that Hollywood films so often define. We feel like these two very different people find commonality in gender and class without losing their personalities at the same time. The movie reminded me at times of Roger’s famous quote about empathy, about how film has a gift to put us in someone else’s shoes in ways that nothing else does. Mitsuha and Taki would likely never interact in the real world, but they start to become supportive of each other, and essential to each other’s happiness. The idea that someone you’ve never met and would never otherwise interact with has the same needs, joys, and fears as you is something worth remembering in 2017. It reminded me of “Arrival” in the way that film takes an out-of-this-world concept and then ties it to issues with which we can all relate.', 'Most of all, “Your Name” balances fantastic beauty and grounded reality in ways that are simply impossible outside of animation. Shinkai alternates between detailed visions of Tokyo that feel like they were constructed from real location photos and fantastical images of places that don’t exist in the real world, and never skews that balance too far to either side. It becomes more and more impressive. Few animated films in recent memory have built scene upon scene to such a rewarding final shot.

It’s inoffensive enough for kids, I suppose, but lack of offense is hardly reason to embrace a story. If I had a kid I wanted to inculcate with the attitudes of openmindedness that exploring the alternative worlds of fantasy fiction requires, I wouldn’t mind showing her this… but I’d want to move on right away to something with more heft, like The Lord of the Rings or even The Chronicles of Narnia. Because even an atheist can embrace the Christian Narnia as a fantasy realm that is consistent and grounded in its own distinctive philosophy, and Narnia works especially well to introduce children to other concepts… like the notion of religion itself as fantasy.', 'But the world of Airbender feels phony and lacks cohesion. Four different nations corresponding to the traditional elements — air, water, fire, and earth — and the people of those nations can manipulate their national element but not the others? That feels like a game of Magic: The Gathering, not a functioning human society. Even if you want to attribute the magical abilities to genetics, there wouldn’t be such clear-cut divisions in powers: it would be like saying that people can have white hair or black hair or red hair, but no shades anywhere along the spectrums between. And certainly not so that it would be possible for, every generation, a single Avatar and not one more, a sort of Dalai Lama-esque figure, to arise, someone who can control all the elements magically and hence somehow keep the peace among the nations.', 'It’s not just a matter of religion here: the magic is real, just not in any way that seems plausible even on its own terms, within its own context. And the lack of storytelling finesse in the worldbuilding is equally lacking in the nitty-gritty plotting and character development. Since today has been a bit of a Pick on M. Night Shyamalan Day, I’ll say something nice about him: If I’d seen the TV series before I saw his adaptation of it, I wouldn’t have been quite so hard on him, because he appears to have picked up the stilted, juvenile writing and scenarios seemingly designed to appeal to the kindergarten set of his movie directly from the soure material.

Mostly it’s a lot of juvenile bickering among Aang (the voice of Zach Tyler: The Ant Bully) and teenaged siblings Katara (the voice of Mae Whitman: Teacher’s Pet) and Sokka (the voice of Jack De Sena). Oh, and Sokka won’t shut up about how hungry he is, which is hilarious, because teenaged boys are always eating: that’s pretty much the extent of the wit here. But even when Airbender wants to be serious, it falls flat: When Aang discovers that his home has been destroyed and everyone he knew and loved is long dead and gone, he grieves by… playing a game with Sokka? Really? These three sound and act like modern contemporary kids, not the products of a culture deeply alien to our own.', 'And as is to be expected from a relatively modest TV series, the animation is not particularly inspiring or beautiful: it’s functional at best.

I watched the book of air several years ago and thought the same as you since I’m already accustomed to animation and storytelling of much higher caliber, which was why I held off on watching the rest of the series until very recently.', 'I don’t know how much stock my opinion will carry here, but the book of earth (the second part) is actually much better in almost every regard. The animation is more fluid, the pacing is tighter, several fan favorite characters were introduced here, the drama is weightier with the death of several, and it even won some Emmys for writing. The philosophy is better fleshed out as the character of Zuko spends more time elaborating the relationships between the elements, and after a rewatching of the first season it turns out that the series is loaded with all kinds of subtle foreshadowing that doesn’t pay dividends until the later seasons.', 'But part of the fan fervor I believe comes from the fact that a kid’s show was better than their preconceptions, and that plot continuity such as was displayed here, or on Gargoyles and the like, is very rare for the demographic intended.', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFASos1G-5U\n(one of my favorite scenes from the book of earth, which is quite sad in context)', '\nI mean, I could try to explain why I think this show is so good, but what would be the point?

Prior to the episode, the flying bison has been kidnapped and does not appear, and Prince Zuko and Iroh are trying to get away with a normal life in an Earthbender city.  That’s all the preface necessary.', 'I would recommend that you watch books two and three as well.  The complexity and caliber of the animation ramps up and the series really comes into its own.  There are some breathtaking moments in the series finale that literally made me cry.  I am an illustrator and graphic designer, so I am quite picky about animation.  I like GOOD animation (aka Miyazaki, Brad Bird, and the like).  Season one is much simpler in scope than seasons two and three.  Give the rest of the show a shot and you might just change your mind!

But you say I “can’t possibly” change your reaction- has no one ever convinced you to change your mind?  I’m not arguing about Avatar specifically, it’s just a general thought I’ve had for a while.  I’ve always wondered how often critics change their opinions on things.  I mean, I’ve discussed movies or TV shows with friends and changed my opinion on whether they were good or bad, yet I rarely see professional critics do so.  Maybe it’s just because they (you) tend to spend a lot of time thinking the subject over before giving an opinion, so it’s more final by that point?  I don’t know, I’m just curious.', 'And this is me coming back once more after reading the above comments and noting that the link vucu gives is one of the stories in Tales of Ba Sing Se.', 'I just finished watching the series with my 10 yo brother, and I found it enjoyable. It wasn’t the best thing I’ve ever watched, but I think it had strong characters that were both male and female and of varying races, which is rare for kids shows, at least that I’ve seen.', 'I actually felt that the episode felt out of place in the narrative as it was in the middle of a string of intense episodes, but yeah, as a standalone, it had some of the best scenes in the series.', 'What made me watch the series from start to finish was that I started mid-way.  I didn’t watch from the beginning.  Due to a marathon and my DVR, I watched Tales of Ba Sing Se and the fourth-to-last episode of season 3, where they’re all performing final training against the rock statues.

It’s always been about stories that are complicated and open to varied interpretation. But there isn’t enough there there in *Airbender* to leave any room for that.', 'While admittedly “book 1” was a little lighter than, and more about laying groundwork for the rest of the series, I do wonder if your reaction might somewhat result from already being tainted by the horror of the apparently craptastic movie…', 'I’m sure that M.K.S.’s movie has ruined an entertaining show for many who might’ve otherwise enjoyed it.', 'I understand your disinterest in the show but I am telling you from the experience of not really caring about the show… you really should watch the other two books.

Just go along for the ride and have fun. In the last two books (Earth and Fire) we get to see the characters grow so much, as well as meeting new ones, and there are themes that come into  play that adults can understand and be entertained by much more than book one… and it all leads up to the final showdown between Aang and the Fire lord Ozai.

Unlike other pre-teen oriented fantasy cartoons, Avatar seemed to at least operate by a consistent set of rules.  Yes, the characters are annoying and ill-defined at first, but they’re kids and they do grow into more mature and complex characters.', 'I also note in your review that you had problems with Aang’s finding out about the Air Nomads and… running off to play Airbender games with Sokka.  I don’t think you noticed that earlier in the episode, Aang is in a ton of denial: he’s still coping by his measurements the fact the Monks told him he was the Avatar (why he fled the temple and froze in ice for 100 years), and he’s still in denial that he’s been gone so long that nearly everyone he knows would really be dead.  Even when Katara warns him the Fire Nation wiped out the Air Nomads, Aang doesn’t buy it.  He doesn’t find the bones of his mentor Gyatso until after he plays those games.  And only then does Aang freak out and enter the Avatar state, unleashing a wind blast of furious anger that only Katara can calm.', 'As for the kids acting like contemporary teenagers… well, you never want to make your characters too alien to your intended audience (kids, teens and fanboy geeks who won’t get out of their parents’ basements).  Why else did Tolkien make his Hobbits so… humanly British?  :)', 'You gave it a shot, not your thing. I liked the first season for the characters, the humor, and the respect it had for its audience, even if they were primarily young children.', 'However, and this is important, the show grows with its audience in a way I’ve seen in precious few other shows. The two best characters in the entire series aren’t introduced until next season, and while the broad strokes of the characters’ personalities are remarkably consistent, they are filled in with a very authentic sense of children growing up.', 'Also, Nickelodeon realized, with this season you’ve just watched, that the show was striking a chord, and with viewers well outside the 6-11 year old demographic they expected. As a result, the writing became much more nuanced and the budget for the show was increased dramatically. The last 4-part episode is as beautiful as any animation I’ve seen, and I’ve seen a lot.

Some of the moralizing in the first season can be excruciating. There are some really good concepts in the series, in my opinion (Aang still being a child with a really heavy destiny, Katara working to learn all she can about waterbending while running up against some really shitty cultural expectations, and most things to do with Toph), but Maryann acknowledged that. There are some good concepts, but she feels other books and movies did it better. ', 'Personally, I do feel that Avatar has much stronger female characters and a more positive message for girls than Narnia or Lord of the Rings (though I love both those books), but that’s a long textual debate that I’d rather not get into without being asked.', 'Asking someone who didn’t enjoy the first season to just give the next few seasons (something like 30 hours of television time, or more!) a chance is just not a great idea. You asked MaryAnn to try it, she did, and she didn’t like it. Oh well, let’s get on to the next Female Gaze entry.', 'Well, this is a relief to me, frankly.

Of course you may have neither the time nor the inclination; how people’s opinions change is just a subject that interests me in general.', 'It’s a shame that you didn’t like it, because I truly feel that it is really a great animated series. I agree that the first season is not as adult friendly as the other two, but it is the introduction. Aang is still a kid in denial about his true destiny, not really understanding that he is the only hope the world has. It’s childish feel reflects the feelings that the main character is experiencing. Also, get your facts right, please, because the episode that you referred to when Aang “discovers that his home has been destroyed and everyone he knew and loved is long dead and gone, he grieves by… playing a game with Sooka” he still doesn’t believe that everyone is dead or that the place is deserted when he plays air-ball with Sokka (that is how you spell his name). He believes that they are hiding or are somewhere else in the Southern air temple. You also said that the show lacked wit and it’s humor only went as far as Sokka always being hungry, well, that is true, but these are kids, what you don’t understand about that, I have no idea. They are children about to take the weight of the world on there shoulders, not yet fully understanding what that means. As for you going easy on M. Night Shamalon, he left out a large amount of the foreshadowing, many characters that play huge parts in the next two seasons (Jet, anyone? Haru? Suki?) and got the mythology wrong, which becomes very important as the next two books develop. On top of that he couldn’t even get the pronunciation of the characters names correct and had a horribly written screenplay. Like I said, it is a shame you didn’t like the show, but it sounds like, to me, that you didn’t fully understand it and you went in with your opinion already formed.

Definitely don’t waste your time if u hate it, its takes patience but u are missing out on a classic story, not just a kid tv show.

U got those who take it for what it is and u got those who have to prove their intelligence and over analyze it. That being said my explanation of why I love the show so much. What caught my attention at first was the action. I’ll admit the animation is choppy at times but the action scenes were epic & very fluid but I honestly believe that the creators did that on purpose cause the cartoon has mixed styles of animation, not like the cheap 70s Hanna Barbera cartoons. Then I liked the comedy of show. The show has a great balance of comedy, action, drama. Then I started to pay attention to the story(nick marathons of course) & by the middle of the 2nd season I was hooked especially when Toph comes in. The cartoon appealed to kids but it was definitely made for teenagers and adults. The details of show are so concrete u cant help but to believe in this world. From the history & politics to the clothes & money the kids used in different cities. I’m still lookin for mistakes the writers might have made in the back story. Even the filler episodes(and there is alot) have purpose. It all comes together at the end of 3rd season. I dont watch alot TV but I havent been excited bout a show like this since Curb your Enthusiasm & Seinfeld which I started watchin 6 years ago.I just love great writing & story telling.', 'Eeheehee. I’ve seen a little bit of “Avatar,” and I was impressed by the characters that felt like real kids, the fairly lush backgrounds and sense of place (a hallmark of Japanese and European animation and comics, but often absent in American works IMO), and generally the ambitiousness of a fully serialized cartoon series, which is pretty rare in America. At the same time, I didn’t feel engaged by it dramatically, and the emotions felt kind of “flat” in the way that MaryAnn describes. In the end it never really grabbed me.', 'So basically, while I can appreciate the ways in which many other people like it, I also very much enjoyed reading a negative review. I guess since I take a dispassionate view on the show, I like seeing both opinions articulated.', 'As an adult, I did not start watching this series from the beginning, I watched somewhere near the end of Book 2 and the rest of Book 3. The last two books are definitely my favorites in the series. When I finally got to Book 1, I was disappointed because it wasn’t as good as the other latter books. But if you take the series as a whole, the characters really do evolve through 3 books and there’s so much transformation and growth.  ', 'I don’t think this has been mentioned but in the last 2 books and even a bit in the 1st book, there’s so much social justice and wisdom tied into the story arc–this is what makes me, as an adult, love this series. In Book 3, Aang struggles with the concept of ending one person’s life–when everyone in series justifies ending one person’s life by an eye for an eye, Aang believes there has to be an alternative way.  In another chapter of book 3, we learn that a factory (from the Fire Nation) takes over the land and water of a village and heavily pollutes it. The factory claims its helping the village but really, they are making the villagers sick with  their pollution.  Katara empowers the whole village to reclaim their land and water from the factory and in the end, the villagers help clean up  and restore their waters.  These are just some issues that you can tie into real life and one of the main reasons I love this series so much.  You really can’t just judge the series based on the first book even though it does have some social justice issues in it (example: the chapter with Hei Bai spirit, ealing with genocide) but the whole series is all about balance.', 'Speaking of balance and tying it into Asian cultures and mythologies, it’s not often you see an American cartoon depict cultures from different countries that are not European.  Not only did this cartoon introduce the social justice aspect but it opened up the eyes of many to Asian cultures and mythologies–that’s something that Narnia or Lord of the Rings can’t do (because they’re based on European mythologies and I also didn’t see much social justice related issues in those series). Avatar the Last Airbender series showed Asian cultures and mythologies in a way that didn’t stereotype.', 'Well, I’ll try to explain my fascination with the show as best I can.  However, I’m definitely not going to tell you “keep watching, it gets better.”  I would do that for something like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which had a mediocre first season but a solid gold second season (if you do ever watch that, it might be best just to start with S2 and use wikipedia to see what you missed, and save yourself nine hours).  But I wasn’t even aware that there was a feeling amongst so many that the first season of Avatar was greatly inferior to the second.  I like all three seasons, and while the second might be better, it’s not enough of a gulf for me to recommend it to someone who didn’t like the first season at all.  The three seasons follow the same classical three act structure as the Star Wars trilogy: the first season introduces the world and the characters and can largely stand alone, the second season expands it, adds some new characters, and ends on a downer note, and the third season may be a bit weaker but still works as a good ending.  Now, many Star Wars fans feel Empire is the best Star Wars movie, but I’m sure you’d agree that someone who didn’t find anything appealing in A New Hope probably wouldn’t be swayed by Empire Strikes Back.  The reason why the second part works is because you’re already in love with the world and want to see more of it.  If you’re bored by the world already, seeing more probably won’t change your mind.', 'That said, I’m not sure I can sum up my feelings succinctly, so instead I’ll try to respond directly to some of your criticisms.  I have to say, though, I was a bit put off by your saying that “it’s not for adults” and “there’s no depth to it.”  Just because you don’t see any depth doesn’t mean it’s not there.  I only bring it up because you normally come down hard on comments that state opinions as fact.', 'Four different nations corresponding to the traditional elements — air, water, fire, and earth — and the people of those nations can manipulate their national element but not the others? That feels like a game of Magic: The Gathering, not a functioning human society. Even if you want to attribute the magical abilities to genetics, there wouldn’t be such clear-cut divisions in powers: it would be like saying that people can have white hair or black hair or red hair, but no shades anywhere along the spectrums between.', 'Well, the last thing I’d want is to have a character sit down and explain the way the world works, as Katara’s grand-mother did in the movie.  That was my biggest problem with the movie- so much of the dialogue was pure exposition, rather than actual conversation.  There are hints along the way that explain how it all works- sort of like you said with Firefly, it drops you into the world and expects you to pick it up as you go.  For example, in The Fortuneteller (which you did see), we meet two identical twins, only one of whom is an earthbender.  Genetics is part of it, but clearly not everything.  If your parents were earthbenders, you might have the potential to be an earthbender, but even if you do, there’s no guarantee you’ll actually develop that ability.  Part of it may also be cultural- the earthbenders are raised by other earthbenders, so that’s what they learn how to do.  Katara’s a waterbender, but she’s the only one in her village- for whatever reason, none of the others managed to learn.  Sokka clearly wouldn’t have the temperament or patience to master waterbending.  There are some shades of it, too- some earthbenders can bend sand, and some can’t.  One waterbender is able to control other people by bending their blood, in one of the most disturbing things I’ve ever seen attempted in a children’s show..  These are the sorts of discussions that fans enjoy- picking it apart and finding explanations.  Heck, how does the Force work?  What, so Leia was Luke’s sister yet she never felt so much as a tingle of the Force until the end of Empire?', 'And certainly not so that it would be possible for, every generation, a single Avatar and not one more, a sort of Dalai Lama-esque figure, to arise, someone who can control all the elements magically and hence somehow keep the peace among the nations.', 'To quote Sokka (in a later episode): “That’s Avatar stuff.  That doesn’t count.”  The Avatar is a spirit that possesses different people.  It’s not passed genetically- it’s a spiritual power that’s outside the rest of the world.  Now, you probably won’t understand all of it, but you pick up bits and pieces as you go.  The first episode of season 2 explains a good bit more about how the Avatar spirit works.  There are spirits here that can influence the world in clear ways.   Yes, the “magic” of bending is real, but the spiritual aspects of the avatar is separate.  To carry on my Star Wars analogy, hyperdrives and blasters are things everyone has access to and is accepted as fact, but the powers of the Jedi are a separate thing entirely.  The kid can do stuff no one else fully understands, but after a while they accept that it exists and can be trusted.', 'Really?  I don’t know where this comes from.  I think the writing’s terrific.  And I think there’s a lot of good humor, particularly from Sokka (no, it’s not all about food, though that’s certainly a lot of it).  After Katara finds out she has healing powers:', '\nSokka: That would have been helpful in the past- like when I got two fishhooks caught in my thumb!\nAang: Two?\nKatara: He tried to get the first hook out with a second hook.\n', 'I’m not going to tell you you’re wrong if you didn’t laugh, but it wasn’t just “I’m so hungry” over and over.', 'This review is either dishonest or the viewer just didn’t care to pay attention.  This is evidenced by when she refers to how Aang deals with loss “by…playing a game with Sokka?”  If the reviewer had been paying attention, she’d remember that at that moment Aang had not yet realized/accepted the fact that his people were wiped out, partially because Katara was hiding the evidence from him.  Once Aang found the skeleton of his mentor Gyatso, he broke down (in a rather terrifying way, thanks to his Avatar powers).  ', 'The subject is later brought up in the heart-wrenching episode “The Storm”, where Aang deals with guilt over leaving his people right before they were wiped out.  The episode also deals with the past of Zuko, and how his father scarred him then banished him.  I’m at a loss as to how the reviewer forgot to mention the characters of Zuko and Iroh at all, as they are the most interesting in the show.', 'As for why people over the age of 10 enjoy watching the show- I love the fantasy world of Avatar, and don’t see the problems the reviewer does.  Another part is the characters.  Zuko and Iroh are the strongest characters of season 1, and season 2 introduces the villainous sister of Zuko, Azula, and the tough-as-rocks tomboy Toph.  Another big draw of the show is the intricate action sequences, but I suppose that doesn’t appeal to the reviewer.', 'I’m continuing without checking to see if anyone’s responded to me yet.  Where was I?  Oh, yes, the bit about Aang at the temple.', 'From those “facts,” I see a hamfisted and juvenile way of expressing coping with bad news. I do not see any interesting or involving dramatization of a child’s denial and fear. Aang knows he’s been gone for 100 years. He already knows everyone is dead. So you cannot honestly say — despite what the character *says* — that he really and truly believes everyone is hiding unless you believe he is mentally retarded, which he clearly is not.', '(Hope I did the quoting right)  I just watched that episode earlier today to make sure I remembered it correctly, and I have to say you missed the point.  Maybe you’re getting the timeline mixed up- that’s understandable, as you were probably doing other stuff at the same time (that’s not a criticism- I often use the computer and watch TV simultaneously), but it’s gotten you confused this time.  First off, he certainly doesn’t know that everyone’s dead.  Some of his friends were very young and could have still been alive.  Heck, just two episodes later we meet Aang’s childhood friend Bumi, now the Earth King (well, one of them).  There’s also some suggestion later in the series that some people in this world could live considerably longer than we can (I think The Guru said he was over two hundred- am I remembering that right, anyone?), but that’s not really relevant.  Here’s the point:', 'When they first arrive at the temple, Aang’s excited about seeing “the monks,” because he doesn’t believe the Fire Nation could have made it here.  Katara’s worried that they’ve been destroyed, since no one’s seen them in a while, but Aang’s confident they would have escaped, and are in hiding because they don’t know who these newly arrived people are.  While he talks about Monk Gyatso, his father-figure, he never mentions him specifically as someone he’s expecting to see.  He is upset, though, because it’s starting to hit him that Gyatso and many of the others he knew are dead.  So Sokka plays a game with him to try to take his mind off it.  At this point, he’s in a bit of denial, but it’s fairly normal, healthy grief.  The real trauma hasn’t hit yet.', 'Picture this: You’re in a coma for twenty years.  When you wake up, you’re excited to see your family again.  You keep thinking especially about you grand-father.  Of course, he was eighty-five when you went in, so you know he’s probably dead, but you still can’t help think of him.  And even if he is dead, you’ve still got a large extended family who’ll be waiting for you.  But then you find out that your grand-father didn’t die peacefully in his sleeping.  Rather, he was brutally murdered.  Bad enough, but all the rest of your family were murdered as well by the same person (someone who’s still out there, incidentally).  So not only to you have to think about how your family died horribly, but you’ve got no one left with you.  You’re now the Last Johanson: how are you going to deal with it?  Now multiply that to include your entire culture, and you’ve got what Aang had happen.', 'Once Aang found the bodies of Gyatso and the others, he realized that they were all gone.  Up until then, he knew he would be unlikely to find many people who knew him, but he figured there were still Air Nomads out there, and they’d be willing to take him in.  Maybe they could tell him stories about what happened to his old friends and teachers.  Once he realized that a complete genocide had taken place, he didn’t go off to play- he went nuts, let the Avatar spirit take him over, and nearly blew up the whole fucking temple.  I think that’s a pretty realistic reaction to what he went through.', 'And as is to be expected from a relatively modest TV series, the animation is not particularly inspiring or beautiful: it’s functional at best.  The lack of feeling and soul in the story and in the serviceable voice performances is not made up for by stylish, emotional, or dramatic visuals, as is often the case when animation does work to engage the adult imagination. ', 'Well, now, I think the animation is gorgeous.  Maybe some of the faces aren’t incredibly detailed, but that’s okay.  Some of the animation is inspired by Gainax, and some by Miyazaki.  The faces, for instance, are clearly influenced by FLCL.  And Koh, the face-stealing demon, looks just like a Miyazaki creature- it could have been lifted straight out of Spirited Away (Koh was also downright terrifying- I’m sure a lot of kids got nightmares from that scene).  I’m going to quote something a friend of mine wrote to better explain what I’m getting at:', 'Why does “The Spectacular Spider-Man” look the way it does? Why are the models so streamlined and stylized when we grew up with cartoons where the character models were very detailed?', 'The answer is this, it is easier to animate and to animate well. To those who keep on citing shows like “G.I. Joe”, “He-Man”, and other shows from that era, take off the nostalgia tinted glasses and go back and actually look at them. The character models look good when they are static, but the animation is really slow and lousy.  ', 'When Bruce Timm first set out to produce “Batman: The Animated Series”, people complained about his streamlined character models, I know it might not seem like it considering how universally praised he is today, but it was not the case. Why did he do that? Because he knew you got better animation out of it. Less lines to draw means less lines to animate, especially on a TV budget.', 'If you want those detailed models and good animation, you need the budget of a feature length Disney movie, and even then it’s still not a good idea.\n', 'I think the same applies to Avatar.  The models aren’t enormously detailed most of the time, but where it shows is the kung-fu sequences.  Kung-fu master Sifu Kisu performed the motion capture for the action scenes, and it shows.  All the bending moves are actual kung-fu moves, based on several different styles (tai chi for waterbending, for instance).  The action thus is smooth and gripping.  Battles are fast-moving and thrilling.  They could have made the characters much more detailed, but drawing complicated characters over and over again would have made fluid motion much more difficult.  Instead, they went with a style that allows ease of animation, which leads to well-staged, dynamic scenes.', 'As for “serviceable” voice acting, well, I’ll have to disagree on that one, too.  Partly.  Some of the voice actors, especially the late Mako (Iroh), are excellent from the beginning.  However, he was already an established actor.  I may be mistaken, but I think they said that for Avatar, they always cast by actual age.  Rather than a forty-five year old woman, Aang was actually played by a young boy.  This makes the show feel more authentic, but it also naturally leaves them with some inexperienced actors.   Listening earlier to the early episode I rewatched, I can hear some flatness in the voice performance, particularly Katara and Aang.  This is one area that I feel definitely improves over time.', 'Anyway, moving on.  While I said earlier that I don’t think season one is considerably worse than the others, it did have a number of filler episodes.  I was particularly bored when an entire episode would center around Zuko trying to catch Aang, because it was obvious he’d fail anyway (I referred to those as “Zuko E. Coyote” episodes).  From a plotting standpoint, it’s somewhat dull, but from a character standpoint, it’s inevitable.  The whole point is that Zuko really has no chance of success.  Zuko’s the most complex character on the show.  He never admits it, but it eventually becomes clear that his father ordered him to capture the Avatar expecting him to fail- after all, he hadn’t been seen in a century.  Zuko can’t face the fact that his father was an abusive monster, and is trapped on a hopeless quest because he wants to earn his father’s love.  This brings him into conflict with Zhao early on.  Zhao is fiercely loyal to the Fire Nation and views Zuko as a traitor.  At the same time, he knows Zuko’s a better man than he is, which leads him to an obsessive hatred.  After Zuko wins the duel in their first meeting, and Zhao tries to backstab him:', 'Iroh: Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you.  And thank you for the tea- it was delicious.\nZuko: Uncle- did you really mean that?\nIroh: Of course.  I told you, ginseng tea is my favorite.', 'Little moments like that establish just how much Iroh cares for Zuko, and that he’s more of a father than Ozai ever was.  Zuko ends up taking the drastic measure of freeing the Avatar in “The Blue Spirit.”  Perhaps an obvious plot point, but it shows just how far Zuko has gone, and leads Zhao to outright hatred of this treacherous prince.  And yet Zuko still tries to save Zhao in the end.', 'I’ll go ahead and spoil, since I doubt anyone reading this thread is still watching the show.  The second season introduces Azula, Zuko’s sister, who’s their dad’s favorite, and also kind of crazy.  Zuko establishes the relationship at the end of season 1, muses out loud and talking to an unconscious Aang:\n“You remind me of my sister.  My father says she was born lucky.  He says I was lucky to be born.  That’s okay, though.  I don’t need luck- I don’t want it.  I’ve had to work hard for everything in my life and it’s made me strong.  It’s made me who I am.”\nThat one speech just blows me away every time.  Zuko being so proud of his hard life because it made him a better person- it’s just a great character moment, and the actor does a stellar job delivering it.  Anyway, Azula starts chasing Aang instead, as well as Zuko.  Eventually, though, Zuko and Iroh start living on their own, and Zuko starts to find inner peace.  And then Azula shows up with the perfect way to capture the Avatar and the biggest city in the Earth Kingdom at the same time, and asks for Zuko’s help.  On the other hand, Iroh tries to convince him to give up his quest and join with Aang and the others (he’d already spent a good bit of time bonding with Katara in a prison).  Now, the easy way is to have Zuko join up with the good guys at this time.  Instead, he makes his biggest mistake by helping Azula.  He goes back a hero, wins the acceptance of his father, and- realizes he doesn’t really want it.  Only then does he join up with Aang and turn his back on the fire nation.  See, joining when he had nothing to lose wouldn’t have shown any strength.  But seeing him get everything he ever wanted, only to throw it away because it was the right thing to do- that’s a much stronger moment.  It angered Zuko fans at the time, but it was worth it.', 'Someone said that the complex villains are part of what makes this show good, and I agree.  Someone else responded that that’s a bare minimum for adult entertainment.  Well- no, not really, at least not for popular entertainment.  Maybe you want it, but it’s not a given.  Look at the other Avatar, James Cameron’s.  You want to talk simplistic writing- explain to me the complexity of Colonel Killy McDeath and Mr. Slimy Corporate Suit.  Or the average James Bond movie.  Heck, even Star Wars- the Empire is ridiculously evil.  Except for the rather quick redemption of Darth Vader, you’ve got Emperor Snidely Whiplash and Grand Moff “Blow Up a Planet Because It’ll Scare People.”  It may sound like I’m bashing Star Wars a lot, but I love Star Wars too.  I like more, though, a villain whom I can understand, even while I disagree.  And in Avatar, not only are the bad guys not all bad (with the exception of Ozai himself, who’s in the Sauron role of pure evil that motivates the other, more complex characters), but the good guys aren’t all good.  Look at the blatant sexism in the Northern Water Tribe.  I like the idea of Katara standing up for herself when she’s told her gender made her less of a person.  And in season two, we get Toph, a Ripley-type character who was designed as a male but flipped to a female without being significantly changed.  She’s a powerful earthbender whose role in the show has nothing to do with her being a girl.  There are some very good female role models.  As for flawed heroes, we see it even more at the end of season 2 in Ba Sing Se, which is run by a corrupt secret police more interested in keeping order than protecting the people.  They fill the Dolores Umbridge role- someone who should be on the heroes’ side but end up being just another villain.', 'The end of season 2 was pretty daring, for a kids’ cartoon.  Actually, it’s very similar to Empire Strikes Back, to the point where I think it was a deliberate reference (and I don’t think it’s unfair to lift elements from other stories if they feel natural- I don’t think it’s a ripoff).  Aang abandons training with his mentor because he senses his friends are in danger and rushes to save them, but ends up losing a critical battle and getting crippled, while Iroh is imprisoned by the Fire Nation.  The main characters just barely escape with their lives.  Plus there’s Zuko’s betrayal, which I already mentioned.  It’s rare for a kids’ show to end on such a down note and trust kids (and parents) to deal with it.', 'Someone mentioned powerful themes in the story, and they’re certainly there.  One of them is civil disobedience, and asking where true loyalty belongs.  For instance, the Fire Nation priest tries to help the Avatar, despite the Fire Lord demanding he turn him in, because he sees his religious duty to protecting the world as a higher calling than following orders of his nation.  Perhaps this doesn’t work for a nonreligous person, but surely you appreciate the idea of choosing whether to stand up for an ideal or taking the easy route and doing what you’re told.  Zuko is a bigger example- he ultimately realizes that overthrowing his father is actually a way of helping the Fire Nation overcome its warring nature.  The other aspect I really love is the world-building.  Early in S2, we get the legend of how Omashu was founded, and it sounds like a real legend.  In Ba Sing Se, we see a beautiful modern city, but eventually realize it’s corrupt at the core, thanks to the Dai Li (the above-mentioned secret police).  In S3, we see the Fire Nation at last, and realize how the citizens are brainwashed.  The students say a daily pledge to the Fire Lord and are told lies about their own history, such as the claim that they slaughter of the Air Nomads was an honorable battle (the true history goes straight down the memory hole).  That episode also has one of the funniest moments of the series, in which Sokka pretends to be Aang’s father (“[My name is] Fire.  Wang Fire.”  Great pseudonym there.).  And then, when Zuko confronts his father, he dismisses the idea, taught to citizens, that they’re spreading civilization by war as a self-serving lie.  Many fans saw that as a knock at American imperialism.  I don’t know if that was intended, but if the shoe fits…', 'Anyway, that’s my dissertation.  I hope it helps, and I hope 3,000 words wasn’t too much (yikes, am I still talking?).  What surprises me is that you and I agree almost completely on animated features, yet not on animated TV shows (aside from adult comedies like The Simpsons or Futurama).  Maybe it’s for the best that you never got around to watching Gargoyles (I thought you’d like that mainly for the well-researched Scottish history and the Shakespeare references, plus the plethora of Star Trek actors, but it might not have been enough).  But you were moved by Spirited Away, which was a fairly simple story- a very good one, but simple.  I thought Happy Feet looked terrible (most of the ads were little more than Robin Williams mugging for the microphone), but I saw it solely on your recommendation, and loved it.  I still haven’t seen Meet the Robinsons, but I will.  And, of course, The Incredibles.  The point is, I thought you were the type who appreciated animated storytelling.  I thought that you understood that animation could be used to tell any type of story.  Yet your recent comment that you can’t imagine dramatic stories being as good when animated gives me pause.  Something like Grave of the Fireflies is immensely powerful as it is.  The same story could be told in live action, but it wouldn’t be the same movie.  It might be a good movie nonetheless, but, as you’ve said, there’s no such thing as a good story that’s poorly told.  How it’s done is as important as what’s done, and some people are skilled at telling dramatic stories through animation.  It sounded like what you meant was that animation’s not an appropriate medium for adult stories, which is an attitude that always makes me angry.  However, it doesn’t really square with your earlier reviews, so I’m left confused.  I hope this conversation helps us better understand one another.', 'You’re now the Last Johanson: how are you going to deal with it? Now multiply that to include your entire culture, and you’ve got what Aang had happen.', 'I’ve never seen the TV show, and never will (generally, I can’t stand Japanese animation; nothing to do with the story, I just hate the art).  But this reminds me, somewhat, of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  I am a devoted Mystie, but I know many people just think the show’s stupid.  Now, I can roll my eyes and say “they just don’t get it,”  but that’s not true.  As MaryAnn has said, you can’t argue someone into enjoying something.  ', 'People: she doesn’t like your show.  Get over it.  I could spend decades carefully analyzing every word of the Twilight series, and all the philosophical implications.  I will still think it’s shit; sorry, but that’s the way it is.  MaryAnn disagrees with you… drop it and move on.  Why does her criticism of a freaking kids show stab at you like this?', 'I have a question and u seem like u followed the series pretty closely. I just finished it recently. My question would be did Zuko’s Mom poison Firelord Azulan so Ozai could become firelord and wouldnt kill Zuko his first born? Is that why she was banished? The show never goes in detail about that, kinda leaves it up for grabs. I just remember in Book 3 Chptr 11 when Zuko confronted his dad, Firelord Ozai told him “your mother knew how bad I wanted to be firelord, she did treasonous things that night, therefore she was banished..”, and in Book 2 “Zuko Alone”, it was mentioned that firelord Azulan was healthy but then all of a sudden he died & the mother disapeared.If not then why was she banished? Makes no sense she would be banished just because she stuck up for son & wouldnt let her him be sacrificed by his father. Or is it, we will never know and thats the way the writers wanted it?

Although I’ve never seen Avatar, the concepts seem roughly similar.  Naruto (like Gargoyles and every Gundam series and Dragonball Z… and Pro Wrestling) is clearly a show for children and preteens.  How are the writing and plot elements in Avatar more mature than those found in the average shonen manga?  I get the sense reading these replies that there is a greater emphasis on character development than pure action, that the writing is less melodramatic, and that the world is more fleshed out; is that generally the case?', 'I guess my question is, if you only had enough time to watch one animated series, why would you pick Avatar rather than one of the many anime series that are also populated with sympathetic villains living in a universe where people can use elemental magic and also feature a ragtag group of episodic adventurers that happens to include a young, male chosen one, who is coincidentally the precise age of the target audience?  The lack of pandering, sexist fanservice is a definite plus, but what else does it have to offer that makes it stand out from the crowd?', 'That’s fine, but unless you have an enormous budget, it’s very hard to animate detailed models doing much.  Think about how much effort it takes to draw such detail, and then think about doing it thousands of times in many different poses.  Unless you have a lot of time and money, you end up with clunky, awkwardly moving characters who don’t do very much.  I suppose you could have very detailed talking heads, but they wouldn’t be able to do much.  I think the faces show plenty of expression- they just chose to do so in an exaggerated fashion.  It works, for me.', 'The point is that animation isn’t supposed to imitate reality, but represent it.  You railed against Beowulf, and the takeaway I got from that review was that there’s no point in trying to imitate the human face perfectly in animation, because you’ll never be able to do as well as simple live action filming.  Now you’re asking for more detail in faces, when you hated Zemeckis trying to give too much detail in faces.  Good animation is a stylized representation of reality, not a literal imitation.  I think the overabundance of CGI is leading many people to think that being more “realistic” is always better.  CGI is a legitimate artform, but so is traditional cel animation, and it’s sad to me that 2D animation is getting phased out in this country because it’s not “realistic” enough.', 'Animation is just a medium.

What is story, then?  Some people use it to mean plot, but I’m sure that’s not what you mean.  For me, character is the most important thing, but that’s part of the story as well.  Story is everything.  A good movie doesn’t *tell* a good story, it *is* a good story.  Every aspect of it is part of that story.  I think you mean it the same way, but I just want to make sure we’re on the same page.', 'Of course I think Gargoyles is a good story.  I mentioned aspects of the story that appeal to me and that I think would appeal to you as well.  Scottish history and Shakespeare references are part of the story.  One of the gargoyles helps Macbeth take the throne of Scotland thanks to a bargain with the Weird Sisters.  She later betrays him out of a lack of trust and unresolved guilt over her earlier actions, thus fulfilling the Weird Sisters’ prophecy.  That’s all part of the story.  Even the voice actors are part of the story- Demona wouldn’t be the same character if she weren’t voiced by Marina Sirtis, and that has an impact on the story as well.  All of this is in service of a great story.  I’m not saying that you’ll necessarily like the story.  Frankly, I can’t imagine anyone disliking it, but the above thread proves it’s possible.  But I mentioned some aspects of the story that might appeal to you.', 'It seems to me that saying “Forget those things- I care about the story” shuts down the conversation.  The story is the sum of all of the aspects of a TV show, movie, book, video game, etc.  When you ask someone to tell you about the story, what do you really want?  Do you want to hear about interesting characters?  Do you want to hear about clever and funny dialogue?  All of those things are aspects of the story, and when I mention aspects I think you’ll like, I’m telling you about the story.  Probably you want to hear something about what the story has to say about the world?  I could tell you that Gargoyles has strong themes of anti-prejudice and acceptance of others.  I could tell you that it emphasizes that all actions have repercussions, and that denying responsibility for your actions leads to a great deal of pain for yourself and others.  You’ve described yourself as a pacifist (I think- forgive me if I’m overstating it).  I oppose the death penalty and most aggressive wars largely because of Gargoyles.  At a key point in my moral growth, around the age of twelve, it showed vividly that vengeance begets nothing but a vicious cycle of further vengeance.  But, written like this, all of those are simply morals, and all of them have been told in good and bad stories.  I think Gargoyles does a very good job showing the truth of these ideas, rather than preachily telling viewers that they’re true.  Again, though, you may disagree.', 'And so we’re back to what is story, and what parts of it are important to you?  I can tell you anything you ask about Gargoyles, having been in the fandom for close to a decade and met the main creator in person four separate times.  But I can’t tell you whether it’s a good story.  It’s a good story to me, but the only way you could know if it would be good to you is to see it yourself.  I’m not saying “go watch it” if you don’t think it will appeal to you.  My point is simply that “story” is a vague, massive thing, and the only way I can talk about it is to describe aspects of it.  Everything I describe is part of the story, and cannot be put in a box and separated from the rest of it.  What else can I say?', '\nThe point is that animation isn’t supposed to imitate reality, but represent it.

Not in the sense of cartoon animation, but in the sense of how a human face expresses emotion. And anyway, the issue with *Beowulf* is a totally different from *Airbender,* because Zemeckis clearly wanted his animated characters to look as indistinguishable from humans as possible, which he could have done much better — and cheaper! — if he’d just filmed his actors. That’s not what’s going on in *Airbender.* *Airbender* simply isn’t nuanced in how it is depicting its characters. And before you go into a rundown of the nuance you see: I just didn’t see it.

You probably would disagree.  But at least I know that, so I can better understand where you’re coming from.  To me, I don’t really feel any need for facial expressions in animation to be nuanced.  The animation supports the action.  The emotional content comes from the voice performances.  That’s probably why I like English dubs better than most other anime fans- I have trouble connecting to a character who’s speaking a language I don’t speak.

Now if you add the the foreign gross (54 million) and we have about 188 million worldwide.

Interested in your opinion, I was dissapointed to find that your review makes me question if you even saw the whole season. As many other commenters have pointed out, even your most specific criticisms are riddled with inaccuracies. I admit, when I first saw this season I was very skeptical. And it took me a while to get into it (and I could certainly see how it would take till the phenomenally well done/shocking second-half of the second season) I could see from the first few episodes that the show is different than perhaps anything of television (esp. a children’s show). ', 'There are certainly valid criticisms of the first season: the hit-or-miss children’s humor (including the annoying sound-effects and close-ups that come with it), a couple mediocre filler episodes (esp. “The Great Divide”), and the overall “child” feeling of some episodes (Nickelodeon)… but these issues are purely confined this season. And while the series certainly still had it’s problems (very few don’t), Avatar (to answer your question) forever remains to appeal to adults for it’s fantastic/absorbing world, complex characters, thought-provoking and thrilling story, dark political themes/storytelling (mainly in season 2 & 3), and the fantastic animation. ', 'Seeing as you seem confident that the show is simplistic and bad despite the barrage of angry commenters, and the fact that this show is perhaps the most critically acclaimed kids show in recent memory, a recommendation to truly watch the show would be futile. But I’ll put it out there, I’ve seen many — including I — that weren’t fully on board with this season, but were blown away by season 2 and 3.', 'If you have the time, I recommend you check out episode “Zuko Alone” or — in more spoiler-y terrritory — “City of Walls and Secrets” or “The Crossroads of Destiny” as examples of the fantastic writing, characters, and themes the show has developed.', ' “But even when Airbender wants to be serious, it falls flat: When Aang discovers that his home has been destroyed and everyone he knew and loved is long dead and gone, he grieves by… playing a game with Sokka? Really?”', ' I would like to help you with your analysis by providing a perspective you may not have considered. ', ' The impact of Aang’s realization did not fully sink in until he saw the skeletons inside the chamber. When Aang played the game with Sokka, he had not yet seen proof of the death of his friends, and was in denial about the whole thing. He used the game with Sokka to distract himself from the lingering dread that something was wrong with his beloved home. He was distracting himself, as any kid might (no matter in what time period or universe), from the possibility that his world had been destroyed.  ', 'When he finally realized the truth, his guilt, sorrow and rage pierced his\nheart and my own. I saw him reflected in me. I saw the worlds I had left behind in fear, and the ruins I had returned to. Aang fled the monks a hundred years ago because he knew in his heart that he needed to remain a kid awhile longer and that diving into intense Avatar training would break his spirit instead of strengthening it. And although he did not understand his own motives at first, his choice wasn’t purely selfish. In the end, he was a stronger Avatar for it. ', 'Do you remember a time in your life when you fled an obligation others had placed on you, experienced guilt, (self-inflicted and from the outside) and your decision still worked for the greater good? With Aang’s help, I’m seeing my fears of certain obligations as natural guideposts along my journey toward self-realization. I understand now that I don’t need to break my spirit to get where I need to be; that I really can have what my heart desires. I am learning to have patience with myself, to forgive myself for my weakness, and am all the more thankful for the loving support I have received from friends and family who see my uniqueness and to this day are driving me along my own “Avatar” path. They know it’s all for the good. So do I. Big things are bound to happen. ', 'And that is exactly what Aang went through, to a T. No, I’m not just extracting a kernel of truth from Aang’s otherwise shallow development, I’m not imagining things that weren’t there, and I’m not saying anything I wouldn’t have said immediately after watching Season One. It’s all there. If you don’t see it, with all due respect, that’s your problem, and no one else’s. ', '“These three sound and act like modern contemporary kids, not the products of a culture deeply alien to our own.”\u2028\u2028', ' Fantasy storytelling is not always meant to project realities “alien to our\nown,” although it certainly can. At its core, fantasy reflects our own nature and reveals our own world to us from an altered perspective. ', ' Avatar achieves this in its division of four elements, although you bring up a valid point about the split seeming artificial. Yes, in real life, there are natural gradations between personality types, cultural divides, and belief systems – everyone has a bit of everything – but Avatar encourages you to think of the four nations and four elements in the same way one might view the major arcana of Tarot. Obviously, in real life, not everyone is limited to a single personality trait or the use of a single “element,” and Avatar does not intend to say so. In fact, it is clearly conveyed throughout every season and episode of Avatar that the elements are meant to unite and that their separation is an illusion. ', 'Each element has its own positive and negative aspects, strengths and weaknesses. Aang’s airbending prefers ducking, weaving, seeking strategic angles from which to strike. (The universe seems to wait a hundred years for the “right angle” while Aang is trapped in ice.) Aang later (mild spoilers of season two, which I think you should hear) struggles with his opposite, earthbending, which demands him to face his fears head on. There’s no fancy footwork to moving a rock. You just push. Hard. You can draw a parallel all the way back to Aang’s behavior at the air temple, playing the game with Sokka. Following his airy nature, he preferred to skirt reality until it was too late. But the wonderful lesson he learned, over a much longer series of events, was that it’s never too late. With air and earth combined, Aang waited until the time was right, maneuvered into the correct position (or rather, allowed the universe to move him), and hit like a truck. ', 'We are all Aang. Each one of us, and each other main character in Avatar, deals with similar struggles to Aang, overcoming fear and guilt and pursuing a genuine path, using elemental affinities, personality types, cultural divides, and belief systems, as motifs. All these peel away to reveal the essence. ', 'Aang’s case is just one example of the intricate interweaving of elements in Avatar, the rest of which you are always – always, even in a thousand years – welcome to explore for yourself.', 'It is totally fine that Avatar is not “in your element.” You desire a different\nflavor of entertainment, and I would never try to take that away from you. But just as all elements are essentially one and are meant to accept each other even while apparently separate, you may come to realize someday that all types of thought, when of quality, will send a signal to your heart, telling you that even if you aren’t ready to receive them, they exist. ', 'Avatar thinks on the level of children – you’re right – but not on the level of\nchildren who seek shallowness and flippancy. It thinks on the level of children who have survived countless years of struggle in this world and are still willing to love life as children do.', 'Unless you can explain what you mean in a rational way, I’ll be forced to consider you a troll and delete your comment.', 'So I didn’t read the review completely. I disagree with your opinion of the show, but that’s not what kept me from finishing. What befuddles me is your blatant attack on religion. Regardless of what I believe, how could you possibly bring religion into a review of a children’s pseudo-anime series on Nickelodeon? What business does that have in this review? I find that quite unprofessional. You seem as if you’re just searching for things about which to be unhappy.', 'Because there is no details about story. The one detail about the story you go into you straight up get wrong. Aang did not play a game AFTER he saw the physical evidence of his people being slaughtered, he was playing it BEFORE. While he was playing the game, he assumed they were either hiding in the general area of the temple or simply evacuated. You still haven’t admitted to the mistake or fixed it.

True, many of the concepts explored in the show are pretty basic, and the humor can be questionable at times, but it sounds like you want it to be just a mixture of religion and action while it’s a mix of Eastern philosophy, action, comedy, diverse characters, and spirits, more than enough for an introduction to Eastern religions. If you’re looking for a very in-depth religious documentary, look elsewhere. As for the Avatar Universe, you complain it’s a mess and the nations are divided. YES, it was intended to be that way, not an utopia.

I hope I am mistaken, but based on the evidence you have presented that’s what it looks like you did. Look I know some of the comedy is sub par but really? View the content before bashing it… er… reviewing it. The world building takes place over the whole series and isn’t crammed down our throat in huge exposition dumps like in M. Night’s film.

As for the Tolkien comparison, I found it rather refreshing that this wasn’t another middle earthish bad guys bad, good guys good, series.

Frankly, I commend MaryAnn on making it all the way through the entire first season.', 'OK, I said I was done, but… one last pitch, for readers of this thread in general. Since some commenters have said they’d like concrete examples of the show’s virtues, I’d just like to point out this scene. WARNING: it’s a spoilerish clip from the third season, but to me it exemplifies something Avatar does so well.', 'In just this one scene, the show deals with the atrocities of war; the sacrifices of parents; the way that wars scar children for life; the idea that seeking revenge against monsters makes you risk turning into one yourself; the question of what to do with war criminals when they’ve turned into helpless old men (who maybe even regret what they’ve done); and the idea that the moral choices you make, and not your fighting skills or powers, are what separate you from those you oppose. All this in a storyline that’s not even about the main character.', 'These are heavy themes for any story to deal with, and particularly for an animated “children’s show” with a lot of young fans.

I haven’t read the comments thread because I don’t have time to read through it.', 'I can agree that the first season has “childish” humour, however, this quickly changes throughout the series. I think it’s an unfair judgment based on one season, rather than watching the entire series. If you watched only season 1 of a show like Breaking Bad, there’s no way to have dreamt of the potential.', 'Anyway, I’d like to politely tackle some of your concerns.\n1. The avatar that’s a “Dalai Lama”-esque character? Recall, the Avatar is reincarnated as a different element each time: Water-Earth-Fire-Air. You got to see Avatar Roku, who was nothing like Aang. It’s not every generation; it’s as long as the Avatar lives (i.e. 100 years is not a generation)\n2. A nation being able to control only one element – genetics is probably the best way to think about it, for your sake. The series addresses this much, much later (its sequel, The Legend of Korra). Maybe the reason why these nations can’t learn other elements because they have no one to teach them and their innate stubbornness and selfishness to look at the other nations possibly having useful information.\n2a. If you continue watching, you’ll learn that masters in each tribe can learn a sub-element. (i.e. fire benders learn lightning)\n3. Aang plays a game when realizing his people have died? If you’re 10 and unwilling to accept responsibility, the best way to do it is to run away from it.\n4. Religious connotations? It has more to do with different cultures and their customs – these nations represent more of the Indigenous populations and the ancient Chinese/Japanese. Just because they are not Christian-based doesn’t invalidate it in any way, shape, or form. It’s more on spirituality. I’m an atheist and I looked beyond the need to search for religion.\n5. I refuse to touch the movie.\n6. Was Zuko’s story of exile and having a sociopathic father not compelling enough for you?\n7. The creativity of the animals? Sky bison?\n8. The animation is a Western-Eastern hybrid; it’s unfortunate you don’t see that as inspiring. Also keep in mind the age of the show – 5 years old when you watched it.', 'Anyway, you’re entitled to your own opinion, but there’s to more to the series, especially after Season 1.', 'I believe what Mary Ann was getting at with her rather abrupt response was, simply saying something is well written or full of ingeneous concepts is not adequate proof. Your word is not above scrutiny. Even if you were an… animated media expert (if such a thing exists) your word alone wouldn’t be proof enough that you are correct in anything you have said (not that there is an objective truth that can be said regarding most art). For any statement you have made about the merits of this show, you should have provided examples (from said show). As much as I disliked Mary Ann’s review she did provide examples to back up her opinion. You however need to organize your thoughts and come back with a legitimate argument or no one will take you seriously. Oh, and no one take this wall of text seriously as it is written by an ignorant Canadian who thinks an 85% in grade 12U English makes his opinion matter.', 'Careful that you don’t say anything too dislikable though, or the public might force you to sell your site   ; ) Free speech only applies if you say the right things.

Apparently it can never be repeated enough: Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences for the stupid/evil things you say. Freedom of speech does not make every word equally valid.', 'I know this was posted quite awhile ago, but hear me out: I urge you to watch this show in it’s entirety, or at least through season 2. The season 2 finale is one of the strongest episodes in the entire series. It serves as a sort of Act II finale, as by the end of the episode virtually all hope is lost. The entirety of Book 2 is much less choppy than Book 1, and each episode is extraordinarily well-written. In my opinion, Book 1 of the show is worth skipping as whole, save for the first two episodes and the last three episodes, and the fact that many of the characters and themes established in Book 1 appear later on in the series. When I do marathons of the show, I sometimes skip Book 1 as it is truly not as enthralling as the two seasons that follow it. Book 2 never has a dull moment, and I think it would be wise to continue watching in order to make a truly educated opinion of ATLA.  If you would like, I could give you a list of the episodes that focus purely on story progression so you could fairly judge the skeleton of the overall plot. Though without the rest of the “filler” episodes, a lot of character growth and development is missed. The episodes that the story truly hinges on are 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 18, 19, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 40, 46, 50, 51, 58, 59, 60, and 61. This way, you can make a review on the main plot as a whole in the time it would take you to watch season 1 fully.', 'Dude, don’t do this. She watched the show. She gave it an entire season to catch her interest. It didn’t. And that’s fine. Because, you know what? It’s just a TV show. Don’t be that guy, the one who just won’t shut up about that thing that he really likes but you can’t stand. Just, don’t. OK?', 'As I’ve said elsewhere in this thread, this is not a reasonable request to make. There’s too much else I would rather watch, too much else I would rather do, than invest even more time in a show that has failed to capture my imagination.', 'Oh my gosh, believe me when I say I understand what you mean. My boyfriend wanted me to watch this show, so I started watching it… And, I mean, it started off… okay. But it didn’t really move anywhere. The writing was very childish and the plot quickly grew stale. I stopped watching less then halfway through season 1. I thought he was crazy. I looked through some of the IMDb reviews just to see if it was actually as widely acclaimed as he made it seem. And yeah… all around, full-fledged adults were giving it 10/10. So I decided to give it another try, as I figured if the show received an Emmy and had such a large fan base, I must’ve have missed the potential under all of the awkward voice acting and silly child humor. After a six-month hiatus, I picked up the show again, and painfully forced my way through the next few episodes. But then, the show started to grow on me. By the time the season 1 finale rolled around, the show had provided an intriguing mythology, some pretty decent animation and action scenes, and even nearly three-dimensional characters. I was actually beginning to enjoy this show. And season two picked up with a blast, never leaving you with a dull moment. What I loved about this show is that it grew with me; it grew from something awkward and ugly into something truly beautiful and unique. The characters established themselves, demanding to be heard, and they almost felt real.  Not to mention (from a somewhat feminist bias), this show has some of the most well-written female characters I’ve ever seen. They are constantly challenging patriarchal themes and gender stereotypes, and teaching girls young and old that they do have the power and potential to do anything they please. The writing only grows stronger and more elaborate; more suspenseful, more dramatic, more comical. Even the animation improves. The increase of fluidity and vibrancy from the beginning of this show to the end is absolutely astounding. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a show that will grow with you, and grow on you. I can honestly say, as a 28 year-old woman, that this has become my favorite TV show of all time. The grandeur of the rich fantasy and diversity of this world rivals that of Lord of the Rings. The character development brings each and every hero/heroine and villain/villainess to life. And that’s another thing Avatar does so well. It blurs the lines between good and evil, and sets everyone on an equal playing field of shades of gray. Everyone, even the citizens and leaders of the “evil” Fire Nation, has their motives, and none of them are morally wrong. Each and every character is conflicted. They all feel love, hate, and anything under the full spectrum of emotions. Honor, betrayal, love, revenge, destiny, courage, and friendship are all themes expressed in Avatar. This show honestly does fantastic storytelling on the level of any  of the greatest of the greatest films, books, or television series, and it manages as a children’s show. Avatar fulfilled its destiny as the greatest feat of animated storytelling of all time. Believe me when I say, this show is worth giving second chance. P.S. To give you an idea of how skeptical I was, it took me 8 months to drag myself through the first season of 20 episodes (which was admittedly a hellhole at the time, although looking back it now holds some nostalgic value). Once I reached season 2, I finished the remaining 41 episodes in under a week. ', 'I think it’s okay that this show (or any show) may not be everyone’s cup of tea. By now MaryAnn must have had hundreds of comments urging her to give the series a second look; if she decides it’s not for her, and that she’d rather spend her time and attention on other things, c’est la vie. (And at this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if the constant badgering from fans is making her dislike the show even more.) Let it be.', 'Having said that, I do think yours is the most eloquent (and civil) defense of Avatar that I’ve seen on this thread. And, as a fellow fan, I appreciate the enthusiasm. :-)', 'Any potential replies should be made after viewing the thread from oldest to present. And yes, this show is like Bioshock Infinite, you either really love it or really hate it.', 'Why don’t you finish the next two seasons? You can’t judge a show by its first season. They were trying things out, seeing what worked, and obviously didn’t have that much character development in the beginning. Almost every show I’ve watched picks up by the second or third season, and (those shows aren’t even kid shows)!', 'One day, the world is going to end, and MaryAnn will be sitting in an underground bunker in the middle of an empty wasteland. Suddenly, she’ll hear a knock on the door, and a voice will say, “You really didn’t like Avatar: The Last Airbender?”', 'Mary Ann, first, I would like to build goodwill by commending you for taking the time to not only read through so many comments, some of which are civil and some of which are rather disrespectful, but to also reply in an attempt to have a discourse with your readers.', 'Now, so there’s no confusion where I’m coming from, my opinion could not be more opposite than yours. I love this show. In fact, I love it so much that I have watched the show at least five times through. I post this response not necessarily to make you like it, for as you have said, sometimes you simply to do not like something, whatever the reason may be. No, I post this in an attempt to respond to your query: why would adults like this show? I hope you are patient as you read this, for I have a lot to say, and it may not always seem that I’m going somewhere with it.', 'First, I will concede to this; the first season especially does feel like several adventures strewn together. There is not a ton of urgency in any of the episodes. The plot cohesiveness is not as strong in Season One as it is in the others. Still, I believe other aspects of the show overshadow this and hook most audiences.', 'Now, I will address three points in your article. The first is, yes, the show missed an opportunity for an emotional punch by distracting Aang from the fact that his people were destroyed. However, in my opinion, Aang’s denying this reality is not unbelievable, and Katara and Sokka hiding the truth from him, while perhaps foolish, is something a real person might do. So, while this understandably bothered you, I hope you can see why it wouldn’t bother others, such as myself, at least to the same extent.', 'Second, you have trouble accepting the world as portrayed by the show, and this made it difficult for you to enjoy. You think of the bending abilities in a scientific fashion, and, I must say, your analysis was very well thought out. What I would say is that the bending is genetic. Fire benders pass on fire bending genes, and earth benders pass on earth bending genes (the sequel series confirms that it is possible to have an earth bender and a fire bender come from the same family if there is inter-marrying, it is just that in ATLA, there isn’t intermarrying that we know of). Much like magic can exist in a fantasy world, bending can exist in this world. Why you can’t both fire bend and earth bend, I don’t know. People who enjoy the show are able to accept this premise, and I don’t most people think about it in the depth that you do. Therefore, while your objection is valid and well though out, I don’t think many adults would share it.', 'Third, is your comment about the humor. Yes, Sokka tells jokes about meat, but, to quote season three “[Sokka] tell[s] bad jokes about plenty of other topics, too”. There is also a good amount of humor brought in by Iroh and Zuko’s interactions. If an adult is looking for humor, as someone who as seen the show many times, I believe it unfair to say there is none to find that is worthwhile.', 'Now that I’ve hopefully given a few convincing reasons why an adult would not dislike the show, I hope to explain what its appeal is.', 'I thought the animation was good, neither poor nor phenomenal. There were a few moments in Season 1 which I thought were very well done, namely when Avatar Roku destroyed his temple, when Admiral Zhao killed the moon, and when Aang became the Ocean Spirit and drove away the Fire Nation. The battles, overall, were entertaining, especially Zuko vs Zhao in episode 3 and Aang vs Bumi in episode 5. In Season 2 and 3 the animation and battles are much better.', 'The voice actors, I believe, did a great job of conveying the emotion of their characters, one of the best moments being when Aang attempts to fire bend and burns Katara (Katara, Sokka, and Aang’s reaction were all well done). ', 'However a few well animated scenes and decent voice acting is no reason to enjoy a show. It is, however, something that can draw an adult in.', 'What gives this show value are the characters, both in the way they are portrayed and the lessons they give. What then gives those characters and the lessons value is the fact that is it realistic.', 'The characters are real; I never found them to be one dimensional or contradictory. They face problems, they have to work through them, and they are not always up to the challenge. Katara is strong willed, brave, and talented; of course she would challenge Master Paku to a battle. Still, in the fight it was very clear that Paku was humoring her and that she couldn’t win. Her determination was real, but so was the fact that she wasn’t an expert. The characters have to learn. They don’t always know what they are doing, and they sometimes make mistakes, like when Aang was impatient when he tried to fire bend, when Aang hid the location of Katara and Sokka’s father, when Katara and Sokka, in anger, abandoned Aang for hiding that location, or when Katara stole the water bending scroll and placed the whole group in danger because she was jealous. They struggle, and they work through it. It’s real.', 'Next is how the characters are equal. The show quickly equalizes both race and gender by having a diverse cast and powerful female characters (in Season 1 it’s just Katara, but four others show up in Season 2). Later, it places great value on human life, and life in general, emphasizes the fact that we all live together in this world and need to treat others with respect, and reminds us that everyone is capable of good and evil. Such lessons are appealing to many, adults and children alike, and, as I am sure a critic as yourself would know, strong moral lesson are often a key factor in whether one likes or dislikes a show. I know this is the case for me.', 'It is true that Sokka, and Katara bicker quite often. This is realistic though. I have three siblings – we have a healthy relationship, but we bickered quite a bit, and still do. And that is something these two have – a healthy relationship, and quite honestly this stood out to me. Katara and Sokka love each other – you can see just how much Sokka cares for his sister when Aang burns her by accident. They have each other’s backs, and their bickering is never so fierce as to pull them apart. This is an invaluable lesson to teach to children, that your brother or sister is your friend and that they should be there for you and support you (one of the great lines of the show is when Sokka tells Katara in Season 3 “you’re my sister, and I will never turn my back on you). So often you see families that fight, and I can say from experience seeing harmful relationships on TV constantly can affect the way your own relationships are going. Therefore, the fact that Sokka and Katara have a healthy relationship with each other (and their father, as you learn in Season 2 and 3) is something which makes this show great and, sadly, unusual.', 'Lastly, is what I think the crown jewel: Zuko. You probably don’t share this opinion, but when watching Season One, I almost wanted Zuko to win, except that meant Aang would loose so I couldn’t want that! His character was very well developed. He was a villain, impatient, angry, and cruel. But he saved his uncle instead of going after the Avatar, showing that he wasn’t all consumed. His motivations were also clearly laid out and very understandable. Not to mention the great lesson Zuko gives of perserverence. Things never go his way and yet he constantly tries and works and works so that one day he might succeed. Though you would be unaware of this coming part, an adult who loves this show would not be. Zuko changes from a villain to a disgraced anti-hero in Season 2. With the help of his uncle Iroh, he starts to overcome his shame and his anger. At the end of Season 2 (cry) it seems that he will stop being evil and join Aang and the others, but then he gives in and helps his sister fight Aang. Halfway through Season 3, though, he realizes that all the honor which he earned by doing evil was nothing, that evil gave nothing good, and he changes his way and joins the heroes. It is the greatest character arc I have ever seen in any show, movie, or book, and the message that it proves is one of the greatest (I believe) there is; you control your own destiny, and you have the power to choose good.', 'As you said in the comments, your reaction is an emotional one. You just couldn’t get into the show. It’s a matter of tastes and preferences. Though I don’t expect my absurdly long comment to make you like this show, I hope you can see where I am coming from, and I hope you can understand why so many like, and even love, The Last Airbender.', 'There are already close to 200 comments on here, a lot of them from fans (including me) who made the effort to explain in detail why they disagree with her. Your comment is just lazy and unnecessary.', 'I don’t per se agree – I enjoy Avatar – but I do agree with some of the critical points here. I never looked at it too critically myself and even avoided the show a little because everyone loved it SO much. I enjoy it but I won’t always defend the quality.', 'Your first mistake was only watching the first season. There is this thing called character debelopement. Also the series had gone on long enough that along with the character development, you get to watch the cast and producers and directors etx. improve too. The art becomes more sophisticated, the voice actors become less high-pitched and more fitting of the characters, and the mood of the show changes to something much more serious and sometimes even quite dark.\nBy the time you get to the third season, you are emotionally invested in these characters, and you are just wishing for everything to be okay.\nThere are complex plots, emotions, and most importantly ideals expressed in Avatar. Even if you don’t appreciate the show, the messages it conveys are works of art in their own rights.

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'The feature-film version of the long-running animated TV series “Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu” only superficially resembles its source material, and it pales in comparison to its cinematic predecessors. Maybe such diminishing returns were inevitable. It would be impossible to recreate the groundbreaking, lightning-in-a-bottle innovation of 2014’s “The Lego Movie.” We saw that earlier this year with the release of “The Lego Batman Movie,” which was consistently zippy and amusing but, inevitably, not quite as novel.', 'Now we have “The LEGO Ninjago Movie,” about a group of teenagers who are secretly ninjas, each with a special elemental power. Their challenge is to take on the evil Lord Garmadon (voiced by Justin Theroux), who also happens to be the father of the team’s Green Ninja, Lloyd (Dave Franco). But while the film is credited to three directors (Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher and Bob Logan) and a small army of writers, it results in only a few clever ideas that are chuckle-worthy, at best.', 'Its strongest bit is the introduction of a live-action cat within this animated setting—dubbed Meowthra in an homage to classic, Japanese movie monsters—who terrorizes Ninjago City when she’s accidentally summoned with a red laser pointer. But the enjoyment of the absurd sight of a cat knocking over Lego buildings lasts about as long as your average viral video—and then you’re stuck realizing how little there is to the script.', 'Part of the problem is that “The LEGO Ninjago Movie” is primarily about Lloyd struggling with his daddy issues and Garmadon trying to figure out whether and how to be a father to Lloyd, whom he hasn’t seen since the boy’s infancy. And aside from Lloyd, the other ninjas are essentially interchangeable, which is a huge departure from the television show. (I have a son who’s almost eight. We watch a lot of “Ninjago” in this house. Ask me anything.) The supporting players’ names and nature-related abilities are all the same—water, lightning, fire, etc.—but they have no discerning personalities beyond that. They are background noise. They are filler.', 'What’s so bizarre about that is that the longtime voice performers from the TV series—who’ve been playing these characters for seven seasons now—have all been replaced with better-known actors and comedians, who then get surprisingly little to do. Nothing against them—they’re all great and they’re solid voice talent, people you’re happy to see whether they appear in TV or film—but they’re not given enough material to justify overhauling the entire cast. The shift seems like a cynical ploy to make the movie more marketable.', 'For the record, they are Kumail Nanjiani (Jay), Fred Armisen (Cole), Michael Pena (Kai), Abbi Jacobson (Nya) and Zach Woods (Zane). Jackie Chan plays their wise leader, Master Wu, and Olivia Munn has a small supporting role as Lloyd’s mom, Koko.', '“LEGO Ninjago” also suffers from its live-action bookend narrative structure, featuring Chan as a store owner who tells the legend of Ninjago to a wide-eyed kid. All that does is explain the presence of the cat and it gets the film’s pacing off to a sluggish start from which it never fully recovers.', 'What it could have used more of was world-building, literally and figuratively. What makes this place different from every other? What makes it better than the world of “The Lego Movie,” where everything was awesome? That movie efficiently and effectively laid out its parameters and characters. This one drops you in—so if you don’t know the show, you’ll have no connection to this setting. Having said that, if you’re a fan of the show, you’ll be struck by how little the movie has in common with it.', 'Despite the grander scale (and bigger budget), the movie doesn’t use the Legos for the thing that makes them fun: the building aspect of them, the possibility of creativity, the way they allow you to push boundaries and come up with structures and characters that maybe don’t make any sense, but they’re cool-looking. “LEGO Ninjago” is essentially an ordinary animated film, with visuals rendered in Lego form.', 'And sometimes the visuals are so garbled, this may as well be a “Transformers” movie, especially as the ninjas climb inside their various mecha to fly/climb/fight/etc. against Garmadon to keep him from destroying Ninjago City. Along those lines, the sound mix often made it hard to hear the quips, one-liners and banter, especially during the big action sequences, of which there are many. Then again, the jokes and the energy as a whole lack the infectious nature of previous Lego movies.', 'Since we’re making all the inevitable comparisons, it’s hard to shake the sensation that Theroux is essentially doing Will Arnett doing Batman in the previous two Lego movies. He brings an amusing buffoonery to this alleged super-villain—a clueless bravado, a total lack of self-awareness—but we’ve heard this shtick before. Even the husky swagger of Theroux’s delivery recalls Arnett’s performances, and it serves as yet another reminder of how superior the predecessors were.', 'And as my son pointed out after a screening of the film (between bursts of singing the TV show’s insanely catchy theme song) the ninjas don’t even do spinjitzu, their stylized martial-arts technique using their signature elemental powers. Not really—not until the end. But maybe we’ll see more of that in the sequel, which is certainly on the horizon, whether it’s merited or not.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

animation "['He’s Batman. (Say it in a low growl for best effect.) The little Lego minifig in black actually works as a superhero. Of course he appeared in The Lego Movie a couple years back, but he was a joke, a sideshow, a parody of the Dark Knight. Would spinning him off into his own movie work as anything other than a caricature, and wouldn’t he be just one joke stretched too thin across a full movie? Wouldn’t the few things that made The Lego Movie stand apart from all the many movies it was aping — The Matrix, Star Wars, every hero’s journey story ever — get lost when it embraced full on an already well-known story? Wouldn’t its plastic-brick-based metaphysical take on the precariousness of our understanding of the nature of reality get lost in the snarking?', 'Well. All of that could have happened, I suppose, but it didn’t. The Lego Batman Movie is a great Batman movie. Maybe the best one yet. It’s a great superhero movie… definitely among the best ones ever. And that’s not in spite of the fact that, yes, it is a parody of Batman, but because of that. Making fun of all the ridiculous clichés and motifs of superhero stories allows Lego Batman to transcend them even as it celebrates them. This is the most gloriously bonkers expression ever of the sublime silliness of crime fighters in capes and tights, and the outrageously over-the-top supervillains they love to hate, and our worship of tales of their exploits.', 'Look: Lego Batman opens with 15 minutes of all-in, all-out action smash-up spectacular, the sort of thing typically considered suitable these days to serve as the climax of a superhero flick: the ending of the film, not the beginning. But this opening sequence goes beyond even that: it brings together just about every bad guy Batman has ever battled — well, the Joker (the voice of Zach Galifianakis: Keeping Up with the Joneses, Birdman) brings them together — in a mad plot to bring an ultimate destruction to Gotham City. Of course Batman (the voice of Will Arnett: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, Men in Black III) stops them. It’s all done in Lego bricks and minifigs, true — oh, the clarity of the plastic in 3D IMAX! — and it hilariously sends up every trope of the dramatic and critical superhero battle. I was breathless with laughter and nerd joy by the end of it.', 'But where the heck can a movie possibly go from there? I was afraid I had just seen my worst fears realized: there wasn’t much more to say, and Lego Batman was going to pad out another 90 minutes not saying it.', 'I was wrong. Lego Batman keeps finding an ante to up in a way that I never could have expected. There is awareness among the characters here that they are living in a world of interchangeable bricks: Batman is a Master Builder who can make new Bat vehicles on the fly, which is a clever way for the script* to deal with the urban destruction left behind when metahumans fight; the bricks can get reused right away. But if Lego Batman doesn’t quite get into metaphysics of awareness like its progenitor did, it does get into the metaphysics of pop culture. Best to know as little as possible going into this movie, so I’d never spoil it for you. But I can say that Lego Batman is one of the most beautiful and outrageously funny expressions yet of the mashup, fan-fiction fan culture that has developed around geek memes and the merry playfulness of geeks. Lego Batman’s kiddie-level but still very insightful comic psychoanalysis of Bruce Wayne is barely the beginning of it. Its spot-on snarky confrontations with superhero rivalry and the bromance between heroes and villains isn’t quite yet the beginning of it. Its references to every other Batman movie (and the TV show!) is still barely the beginning of it. Reaching out across the fourth wall to deal a smack to Marvel superheroes is starting to be the beginning of it. But it still has a very long way to go before it is done.', '(*The script? I’d actually have been quite worried if I’d known, before I saw the film, that it was written by a couple of TV guys, Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, among whose biggest credits are the dumb show American Dad; another dude, Jared Stern, who admits to writing The Internship; and Seth Grahame-Smith, creator of the terrible Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, though his Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is much better. [A fifth writer, John Whittington, is a newbie.] Somehow, it turned out okay.)', 'I laughed out loud so hard at this movie because I saw my own geeky inclinations reflected in it. In Michael Cera’s (This Is the End, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) voice performance as Batman’s new sidekick Robin as a sunny, exuberant nerd overexcited to find himself in the presence of the Dark Knight. In the whipsmart references to so many things that I, as a fairly ecumenical fantasy and science fiction fan, love — and which I never expected to see turning up in a Batman cartoon — that kept whizzing by at faster-than-dork speed. First-time feature director Chris McKay is a veteran of Robot Chicken, the bizarre stop-motion TV cartoon for grownups that is little more than stream-of-consciousness geek mashups. And Lego Batman owes at least as much to that show as it does to The Lego Movie.', '\n\nIf you’re tempted to post a comment that resembles anything on the film review comment bingo card (now updated for 2017’s trolls!) you might want to reconsider.\n\n', 'I’m a little curious now about the “multiple credited writers” effect now. In animation, collaborative writing has been the norm since the Disney days, and Zootopia benefited greatly from this process. In live action, it’s usually a death knell for quality. Is it because live action studios tend to pass their scripts from individual to individual without any collaboration?', 'That’s a fascinating question, and I don’t know the answer. I suspect collaboration is part of it. It also helps if everyone is working toward the same goal, and knows what that goal is.', 'William Goldman wrote a wonderful, frightening essay about his screenplay for Absolutely Power. Everyone involved with the project loved David Baldacci’s novel. Goldman loved it. Clint Eastwood loved it. The studio heads loved it, because it was a huge bestseller.', 'As soon as they hired Goldman, the studio heads said: This book has an ensemble cast. We need a lead character, so we can hire a big star to play him.', 'William Goldman said: The thief can’t be the hero unless he violates the principles he follows in the book.', 'I suspect that something similar happens when there are multiple screenwriters. Each of them may have different goals, and each of them may be hired for a different reason. One person may be hired to “punch up” the dialogue so the star is funnier. One person may be hired to add romantic scenes, or action sequences.', 'Animators, on the other hand, are used to working as a team, because an animated movie can’t be made any other way. Also, if they work for Pixar (or Disney, now that John Lasseter is there), they have a set of guiding principles to follow:', 'But I’m not sure that any of that really explains it. Mostly, I think, it’s luck and statistics. There are fewer animated movies, and they take longer to make, so when a really good cartoon comes to theatres, it stands out against the hundreds of live action films that are released each year. And, as an animation fan, I’d like to believe that the cartoons are made with greater love and care, but I’m biased by the sense of magic I feel whenever I see animated figures moving on a screen.', 'I’m not even sure it’s “Animation is made with greater love and care”. There’s a lot of real stinkers in he animation world too. But I do wonder if it’s more common to see multiple scriptwriters on a bad film because they work serially, compared to multiple writers on a good film working in parallel.', 'Of course, the best thing is that Billy Dee Williams finally gets to play Two-Face, something he’s been wanting to do since 1989.', 'I wish I knew what was going on. Sometimes writing credits don’t represent a whole lot of input. But that would be true of live-action films as well. I still think it works as a general rule that the more writers who are credited, the worse the film is likely to be. But there are always exceptions to rules. :-)', 'Batman fits multiple tones, not sure why every director who’s tackled him recently immediately goes to dark and brooding, so I’m quite excited fort this.', 'Hey, so how did you get to see this in IMAX 3D? All I can find is IMAX 2D showings, which is really weird. If it’s in 3D, then usually IMAX is guaranteed to have the 3D version.', 'Multiple credited screenwriters for a live-action film often means “A and B wrote the first draft; then a few years later when the script actually sold C and D rewrote it and finally E was brought in to fix up the gaping holes found during shooting”. (The word “and”, as distinction from an ampersand, indicates multiple individuals or teams working separately – see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGA_screenwriting_credit_system .) Zootopia has seven “story by” and two screenwriter credits, but six of those story-bys are part of the same team, and the two screenwriters worked together.', 'In this case there are three separate credited groups: Grahame-Smith solo, McKenna & Sommers, and Stern & Whittington.

This unique tale, based on Marla Frazee’s 2010 book of the same name, concerns a suit-clad baby (perfectly voiced by Alec Baldwin), who teams up with his older brother to unfurl the wicked schemes of the CEO of Puppy Co. The ninety-seven-minute project incorporates terrific animation. Additionally, there are a fair share of laughs. There is also just the right amount of heart. For a family film, you can certainly do worse.', 'As an exercise in coherent storytelling and crafting a unique horror opus from an inventive idea, Camera Obscura (2017), which concerns a man with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder who sees upcoming deaths in the pictures he takes, is wholly out of focus.', 'Camino Island (2017) is among John Grisham’s greatest novels; brilliantly penned, characterized and plotted.

Many of the plots and ideas found within its brisk 83-minute runtime are routine. Still, there is an undeniable charm found in the effects, execution, writing, direction and performances that certainly make up for such criticisms. Best of all, the project begins cleverly. It also ends just as well. This is with the most memorable and inventive tale in the entire production. The result is an enjoyable, if minor, descent into fear.', 'Madchild’s fourth solo album,\xa0The Darkest Hour\xa0(2017), is a 14 track knockout. Terrific imagery, wordplay and rhyme schemes; mesmerizing production.', 'Equal parts Stephen King, Michael Chrichton and Jules Verne, The Dinosaur Four (2014) by Geoff Jones is a creative, fast-paced and thrilling debut novel. The plot, which focuses on a group of individuals at The Daily Edition Café suddenly being transported back into prehistoric times, is unique. Additionally, the central figures are lively and wide-ranging in personality. There is also an abundance of differing title creatures found throughout the project. Simultaneously, Jones’ writing is terrific. His in-depth knowledge of the extinct beasts at the center of his tale only makes the fiction even more credible and compelling. The result is an absolute bulls-eye.', 'Writer-director Joe McLean’s The Drama Club (2017) is conventional in plot and characterization. The narrative follows the ex-members of the title high school organization as they reconvene after a twenty-year absence. Their past decisions, along with the not always wise choices they make during their reemergence, continuously challenges this group throughout the brisk eighty-seven-minute runtime. McLean’s independent feature has its share of joyous and sorrowful moments. Still, it holds too rigorously to its obvious cinematic inspirations, such as co-writer-director Lawrence Kasdan’s The Big Chill (1983), to be anything truly groundbreaking. This is despite strong portrayals all-around. The heavy-hitting issues McLean threads into the endeavor are also admirable.', 'Tyler, the Creator’s fourth solo album, Flower Boy (2017), is inventive, beautifully produced and eclectic; another gem in the California born rapper’s discography.', 'Jay-z’s 13th studio album, 4:44 (2017), is among his most thoughtful, concise and introspective efforts to date; remarkable production and mature flows.', 'Visually spectacular, but at its heart routine and a narrative mess, the live-action Ghost in the Shell (2017) has no real soul.

The piece is centered by an excellent lead performance from Brittany Allen. There is also a great balance between dark humor and effective horror present throughout the exercise. The phenomenal make-up, character focus and genuinely tense finale only strengthen this 92-minute masterpiece. Such results in a truly original, surprisingly introspective take on a well-worn sub-genre.

It is one which is much in the vain of Peter Jackson’s Dead Alive (1992). The piece is graced with terrific effects, pacing and depictions.

But after getting over the initial return hump, I found a lot to enjoy about the show.', 'It’s not as smart, clever or subtle as “The Simpsons,” but there’s a lot of charm in here, once you get to know the characters. The backdrop of an animated future world allows the show to delve into areas that a live-action show simply couldn’t go. This allows the series to be sillier and more out-of-the-box.', 'In particular, the best episodes featured stories that were completely off-base, like cats that take over the world, bungled alien invasions and a cascading story of mixed identities when the crew finds a way to switch minds and bodies.', 'Even the stories that have a peripheral social element in them are interesting. For example, the creation/evolution debate is turned on its ear when the crew encounters a race of evolved robots in “A Clockwork Origin.” And even on a more personal level, it was neat to see Bender’s origins in “Lethal Inspection.', 'This may have not been the best time to start watching “Futurama,” but it worked to make me interested in the show… much more than the direct-to-DVD movies did.', 'WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE\nThe biggest stumbling block this season faced was how to get its footing on a new network after several years’ hiatus. At first, “Futurama” tried to be irreverent and socially relevant like “South Park” (at least up to episodes 200/201 of that series). However, without the week-long production schedule that “South Park” enjoys, the episodes would air so late after the event or buzz that it became counterproductive. Similarly, the “Futurama” gang just can’t do political satire as well as “South Park” and ends up pushing an agenda, which really isn’t fun to watch. This is why the later episodes in this season are far superior.', 'BLU-RAY FEATURES\nLike the other Matt Groening shows, “Futurama: Volume 5” includes full-length commentaries on all episodes. There’s also a slate of deleted scenes and the featurettes “Behind the Fungus: Makin’ a Hit Song” and “Previously on Futurama.”', 'Bender gets his first (and only) music video “Bend It Like Bender,” and Fry shares his original comic book video “The Adventures of Delivery-Boy Man.” Finally, the audience is invited to a table read of the episode “The Prisoner of Benda.”']" "[' Animation', ' Comedy', ' Sci-Fi']" Futurama

In the first four episodes of the series, Anakin continues to fight for the Republic against Count Dooku and his droid army of Separatists.\n\nThe Sweatbox Review:\nWhile the reception to the Clone Wars theatrical release may have been lukewarm, no one can deny that the show’s debut on the Cartoon Network was anything less than explosive.  The show became the most watched animated debut in the network’s broadcast history, averaging four million viewers on its debut.  When the show finally made its debut on Friday nights, it found its proper audience and format.  Many critics of the film had complained that it served no more than to be a long promo for the show, but it was successful in bringing viewers to the actual show.  With its successful mix of action, adventure and comedy, the show catered to both traditional Star Wars fans and new younger fans.\nOne of the reasons why the show works and fits perfectly into the new demographic the Cartoon Network is pursuing is its approach to episodic television.  The show broadened the Star Wars universe by giving us a glimpse at new and background characters.  Each episode focuses on a specific theme and character, while at the same time giving the viewers continuation on season story arcs.  The themes include everything from great leadership to conviction, wisdom, and planning. The themes are always well integrated into the storylines for each episode.  Some of the storylines introduced in the first few episodes include the diplomatic battle between the Republic and the Separatists as they vie for different allied worlds.  Another one prominently featured in the first few episodes is the development of a destructive secret weapon by the Separatists and their rivalry with General Grievous.\n\nThe story is a continuation of the movie and takes place during the Clone Wars, sequentially between Episode II and Episode III of the Star Wars saga.  At the beginning of the season, the Galactic Republic is in the middle of the war with the Separatists (the Confederation of Independent Systems) which is under the nominal command of Count Dooku.  The Clone Wars introduced fans to the show by showcasing the pivotal battle at Christophsis and the rescue of Jabba the Hutt’s son by Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka Tano.  The show picks up where the movie ended with the Dark Jedi assassin, Asajj Ventress, still on the loose and working for Count Dooku and the Separatists.  The show also continues to develop the relationship between Anakin and Ahsoka, as well as the relationship between different Jedis and the clone soldiers under their command.\nThe first episode of the show is Ambush and it prominently features Jedi Master Yoda and three clone troopers.  Their ship is ambushed on their way to a moon where the Republic hopes to forge a new alliance with the Toydarian Kingdom.  There, Ventress tries to persuade the Toydarian King of the Republic’s weakness when she is interrupted by a message from the surviving Yoda.  She then challenges Yoda for the king’s allegiance.  If she captures Yoda, the king will unite with the separatists.  Yoda and his three clone soldiers must then battle the entire droid army led by Ventress.  The theme from this episode is “Great leaders inspire greatness in others” and refers to Yoda’s inspiring confidence in the face of the droids.  Overall, it is a good episode and my guess is that it was a calculated move to feature Yoda in the first episode.  Yoda is always a great character and one that fans of the films will be excited to see in more action sequences, as opposed to fans who hated Anakin in the later films.\n\nThe second episode of the series is Rising Malevolence which begins a three-story arc featuring the Separatist battleship Malevolence and its captain, General Grievous.  In this episode, Jedi Master Plo Koon investigates the location of a secret Separatist weapon that is rumored to have destroyed dozens of Republic warships in the Abregado System.  Anticipating a battle, Plo relays his position to Anakin and Ahsoka and requests their assistance.  Unfortunately, they have orders to defend a different area.  Ahsoka, sensing that Plo is in danger suggests that they go and save him.  The story focuses on Plo and his band of clone soldiers and their battle for survival against General Grievous and his ion cannon.  The theme of the episode is “Belief is not a matter of choice, but of conviction” and this relates to both Plo’s belief that they will be rescued as well as Ahsoka’s belief that Plo is still alive.  Overall, it is a strong episode and actually better than the premiere episode.\n\nThe “Malevolence” saga continues with the third episode of the series, Shadow of Malevolence where Anakin is leading an strike against the Malevolence.  He believes that a small force will be able to outmaneuver the ship and strike the bridge, destroying General Grievous in the process.  Meanwhile, General Grievous decides that his next target will be a Republic medical station where injured clones are treated for their battle injuries.  Anakin then leads the pilots of the Shadow Squadron to intercept the Malevolence before it reaches the station.  The theme for this episode is “Easy is the path to wisdom for those not blinded by themselves” which refers to Anakin and his plan to attack the Malevolence.  Once again, this is a strong episode with excellent action sequences and suspense.  I liked seeing Anakin’s personality and determination being developed into the storyline which is a recurring theme in the series.\n\nThe final episode on the disc is Destroy Malevolence, which is also the final episode in the Malevolence three-episode arc.  In this episode, which begins shortly after the end of Shadow of Malevolence, General Grievous is dealing with the results of the previous episode.  He is soon presented with the opportunity to kidnap Senator Amidala who jumps out of hyperspace right into a battle.  Anakin jumps at the task of rescuing Amidala from Grievous and destroying the Malevolence once and for all.  It is good to point out that Amidala has never been a helpless heroine and she also gets into the action in this episode.  The theme for this episode is “A Plan is only as good as those who see it through” and primarily refers to Anakin’s plans to destroy the ship.  Once again, this is a great episode with plenty of great action sequences set inside the Malevolence.  I was glad to see Obi Wan get a little piece of the action on the show and it is great to see the interplay between him and Anakin during the battles.\n\nIs This Thing Loaded?\nI was surprised to see that no special features were included in this release, if only because the Clone Wars movie was released in a special two-disc edition that featured information about these very episodes.  I assume that Warner might be saving content for the intended season release of the show.  Most surprising was the lack of trailers in this release.  In short, there is nothing.\nCase Study:\nWarner has released this in a basic one-disc, black keepcase with a cardboard slipcover.  The cover features the main characters found in these episodes – Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Grievous, and Ventress.  I was surprised to see no Ahsoka on the cover, but she actually does not have any major role in these episodes.  She is however, featured on the back, along with more Yoda and Plo Koon.\n\nInk And Paint:\nMany people have complained about the animation quality of this show, but I think it is good.  As far as CG animation goes, this is very standard quality for television.  Some of the character designs are a bit boxy and square, but this is a conscious choice by the creators of the show.  One, however, cannot deny the quality of the action sequences in the show.  These are some of the best on television and there is very little like it out there.  Each episode is meticulously detailed and there are many Easter eggs embedded into the background animation that should please hardcore fans of the films.  The show is being released in its original television broadcast ratio of 1.78:1, although the show is reportedly animated in the 2.35:1 ratio like the film.\n\nScratch Tracks:\nOne can never deny that Lucasfilm does an excellent job with their soundtracks.  There are so many explosions and battle sounds that it becomes an integral part of the storytelling style.  Once again, they do not disappoint with this release and the soundtrack is of excellent quality.  The special sound effects are crisp and the musical score is soaring.  Warner has released this show with English, French, Spanish and Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound tracks.\n\nFinal Cut:\nI think many people had their doubts about this show after seeing the movie, but I always felt that the story would work much better on the small screen.  Having seen several episodes of the show I feel the same way and think that it should continue doing well on The Cartoon Network.  The show works because it features great action, adventure, and comedy all in one episode.  I like the episodic structure of the episodes and enjoy learning more about the less-known characters in the Star Wars universe.  I was never a die-hard fan of the films, but I have always enjoyed them.  I feel the same way about this show and I think that it has a great appeal with kids and should be entertaining for adults as well.\nAnimated Classic or Back To The Drawing Board?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare with your friends: \n\n\nYou may be interested in these related articles:\n Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Two-Disc Special Edition)\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nLego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\n\n\n\n\xa0\n\nHow would you rate it?\n \xa0 9.20/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\n\n\ndocument.write(\'<a href=""\'+lin+\'""><img src=""http://animatedviews.com/wp-content/banners/side-\'+ban+\'-2x.jpg"" alt=""\'+ban+\'"" width=""123"" height=""\'+hei+\'"" border=""0"" style=""border:0""></a>\');\n\nDirector/writer Robin Joseph satisfies our curiosity about Fox & The Whale\n\n\nThe Star\n\n\nThe 2017 AV Readers’ Choice Poll\n\n\nCoco\n\n\nProduction Designer Carlos Zaragoza puts a smile on The Emoji Movie\n\n\nPixar Production Designer Harley Jessup “remembers” Coco\n\n\n Justice League Action – Superpowers Unite: Season One, Part One\n\n\nMy Little Pony: The Movie\n\n\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\n\n\nDisney historian Didier Ghez reveals the hidden art of Disney’s late golden age\n\n\nThe Lego Ninjago Movie\n\n\n2017 San Diego Comic Con Exclusive\n\n\nA tribute to X.

In the first four episodes of the series, Anakin continues to fight for the Republic against Count Dooku and his droid army of Separatists.\n\nThe Sweatbox Review:\nWhile the reception to the Clone Wars theatrical release may have been lukewarm, no one can deny that the show’s debut on the Cartoon Network was anything less than explosive.  The show became the most watched animated debut in the network’s broadcast history, averaging four million viewers on its debut.  When the show finally made its debut on Friday nights, it found its proper audience and format.  Many critics of the film had complained that it served no more than to be a long promo for the show, but it was successful in bringing viewers to the actual show.  With its successful mix of action, adventure and comedy, the show catered to both traditional Star Wars fans and new younger fans.\nOne of the reasons why the show works and fits perfectly into the new demographic the Cartoon Network is pursuing is its approach to episodic television.  The show broadened the Star Wars universe by giving us a glimpse at new and background characters.  Each episode focuses on a specific theme and character, while at the same time giving the viewers continuation on season story arcs.  The themes include everything from great leadership to conviction, wisdom, and planning. The themes are always well integrated into the storylines for each episode.  Some of the storylines introduced in the first few episodes include the diplomatic battle between the Republic and the Separatists as they vie for different allied worlds.  Another one prominently featured in the first few episodes is the development of a destructive secret weapon by the Separatists and their rivalry with General Grievous.\n\nThe story is a continuation of the movie and takes place during the Clone Wars, sequentially between Episode II and Episode III of the Star Wars saga.

In the first four episodes of the series, Anakin continues to fight for the Republic against Count Dooku and his droid army of Separatists.', 'While the reception to the Clone Wars theatrical release may have been lukewarm, no one can deny that the show’s debut on the Cartoon Network was anything less than explosive.  The show became the most watched animated debut in the network’s broadcast history, averaging four million viewers on its debut.  When the show finally made its debut on Friday nights, it found its proper audience and format.  Many critics of the film had complained that it served no more than to be a long promo for the show, but it was successful in bringing viewers to the actual show.  With its successful mix of action, adventure and comedy, the show catered to both traditional Star Wars fans and new younger fans.', 'One of the reasons why the show works and fits perfectly into the new demographic the Cartoon Network is pursuing is its approach to episodic television.  The show broadened the Star Wars universe by giving us a glimpse at new and background characters.  Each episode focuses on a specific theme and character, while at the same time giving the viewers continuation on season story arcs.  The themes include everything from great leadership to conviction, wisdom, and planning. The themes are always well integrated into the storylines for each episode.  Some of the storylines introduced in the first few episodes include the diplomatic battle between the Republic and the Separatists as they vie for different allied worlds.  Another one prominently featured in the first few episodes is the development of a destructive secret weapon by the Separatists and their rivalry with General Grievous.', 'The story is a continuation of the movie and takes place during the Clone Wars, sequentially between Episode II and Episode III of the Star Wars saga.  At the beginning of the season, the Galactic Republic is in the middle of the war with the Separatists (the Confederation of Independent Systems) which is under the nominal command of Count Dooku.  The Clone Wars introduced fans to the show by showcasing the pivotal battle at Christophsis and the rescue of Jabba the Hutt’s son by Anakin Skywalker and his padawan Ahsoka Tano.  The show picks up where the movie ended with the Dark Jedi assassin, Asajj Ventress, still on the loose and working for Count Dooku and the Separatists.  The show also continues to develop the relationship between Anakin and Ahsoka, as well as the relationship between different Jedis and the clone soldiers under their command.', 'The first episode of the show is Ambush and it prominently features Jedi Master Yoda and three clone troopers.  Their ship is ambushed on their way to a moon where the Republic hopes to forge a new alliance with the Toydarian Kingdom.  There, Ventress tries to persuade the Toydarian King of the Republic’s weakness when she is interrupted by a message from the surviving Yoda.  She then challenges Yoda for the king’s allegiance.  If she captures Yoda, the king will unite with the separatists.  Yoda and his three clone soldiers must then battle the entire droid army led by Ventress.  The theme from this episode is “Great leaders inspire greatness in others” and refers to Yoda’s inspiring confidence in the face of the droids.  Overall, it is a good episode and my guess is that it was a calculated move to feature Yoda in the first episode.  Yoda is always a great character and one that fans of the films will be excited to see in more action sequences, as opposed to fans who hated Anakin in the later films.', 'The second episode of the series is Rising Malevolence which begins a three-story arc featuring the Separatist battleship Malevolence and its captain, General Grievous.  In this episode, Jedi Master Plo Koon investigates the location of a secret Separatist weapon that is rumored to have destroyed dozens of Republic warships in the Abregado System.  Anticipating a battle, Plo relays his position to Anakin and Ahsoka and requests their assistance.  Unfortunately, they have orders to defend a different area.  Ahsoka, sensing that Plo is in danger suggests that they go and save him.  The story focuses on Plo and his band of clone soldiers and their battle for survival against General Grievous and his ion cannon.  The theme of the episode is “Belief is not a matter of choice, but of conviction” and this relates to both Plo’s belief that they will be rescued as well as Ahsoka’s belief that Plo is still alive.  Overall, it is a strong episode and actually better than the premiere episode.', 'The “Malevolence” saga continues with the third episode of the series, Shadow of Malevolence where Anakin is leading an strike against the Malevolence.  He believes that a small force will be able to outmaneuver the ship and strike the bridge, destroying General Grievous in the process.  Meanwhile, General Grievous decides that his next target will be a Republic medical station where injured clones are treated for their battle injuries.  Anakin then leads the pilots of the Shadow Squadron to intercept the Malevolence before it reaches the station.  The theme for this episode is “Easy is the path to wisdom for those not blinded by themselves” which refers to Anakin and his plan to attack the Malevolence.  Once again, this is a strong episode with excellent action sequences and suspense.  I liked seeing Anakin’s personality and determination being developed into the storyline which is a recurring theme in the series.', 'The final episode on the disc is Destroy Malevolence, which is also the final episode in the Malevolence three-episode arc.  In this episode, which begins shortly after the end of Shadow of Malevolence, General Grievous is dealing with the results of the previous episode.  He is soon presented with the opportunity to kidnap Senator Amidala who jumps out of hyperspace right into a battle.  Anakin jumps at the task of rescuing Amidala from Grievous and destroying the Malevolence once and for all.  It is good to point out that Amidala has never been a helpless heroine and she also gets into the action in this episode.  The theme for this episode is “A Plan is only as good as those who see it through” and primarily refers to Anakin’s plans to destroy the ship.  Once again, this is a great episode with plenty of great action sequences set inside the Malevolence.  I was glad to see Obi Wan get a little piece of the action on the show and it is great to see the interplay between him and Anakin during the battles.', 'I was surprised to see that no special features were included in this release, if only because the Clone Wars movie was released in a special two-disc edition that featured information about these very episodes.  I assume that Warner might be saving content for the intended season release of the show.  Most surprising was the lack of trailers in this release.  In short, there is nothing.', 'Warner has released this in a basic one-disc, black keepcase with a cardboard slipcover.  The cover features the main characters found in these episodes – Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, Grievous, and Ventress.  I was surprised to see no Ahsoka on the cover, but she actually does not have any major role in these episodes.  She is however, featured on the back, along with more Yoda and Plo Koon.', 'Many people have complained about the animation quality of this show, but I think it is good.  As far as CG animation goes, this is very standard quality for television.  Some of the character designs are a bit boxy and square, but this is a conscious choice by the creators of the show.  One, however, cannot deny the quality of the action sequences in the show.  These are some of the best on television and there is very little like it out there.  Each episode is meticulously detailed and there are many Easter eggs embedded into the background animation that should please hardcore fans of the films.  The show is being released in its original television broadcast ratio of 1.78:1, although the show is reportedly animated in the 2.35:1 ratio like the film.', 'One can never deny that Lucasfilm does an excellent job with their soundtracks.  There are so many explosions and battle sounds that it becomes an integral part of the storytelling style.  Once again, they do not disappoint with this release and the soundtrack is of excellent quality.  The special sound effects are crisp and the musical score is soaring.  Warner has released this show with English, French, Spanish and Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound tracks.', 'I think many people had their doubts about this show after seeing the movie, but I always felt that the story would work much better on the small screen.  Having seen several episodes of the show I feel the same way and think that it should continue doing well on The Cartoon Network.  The show works because it features great action, adventure, and comedy all in one episode.  I like the episodic structure of the episodes and enjoy learning more about the less-known characters in the Star Wars universe.  I was never a die-hard fan of the films, but I have always enjoyed them.  I feel the same way about this show and I think that it has a great appeal with kids and should be entertaining for adults as well.', '\n\nYou may be interested in these related articles:\n Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Two-Disc Special Edition)\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nLego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\n\n\n\n', 'You may be interested in these related articles:\n Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Two-Disc Special Edition)\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nLego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\n\n\n', '\n Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Two-Disc Special Edition)\nStar Wars – The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Two\nLego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles\nStar Wars – Rebels: Complete Season Three\n\n\n', '\nHow would you rate it?\n \xa0 9.20/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n', '\n \xa0 9.20/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n']" "[' Animation', ' Action', ' Adventure', ' Drama', ' Fantasy', ' Sci-Fi']" "Star Wars: The Clone Wars"

What a space it opens…', 'A story on a new series on spirituality and social justice at The Chicago Sun-Times, featuring one of our contributors.', 'A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably ""Shrek,"" but Brad Bird\'s ""Ratatouille"" is the first one that made me positively desire one. Remy, the earnest little rat who is its hero, is such a lovable, determined, gifted rodent that I want to know happens to him next, now that he has conquered the summit of French cuisine. I think running for office might not be beyond his reach, and there\'s certainly something de Gaullean about his snout.', 'Remy is a member of a large family of rats (a horde, I think, is the word) who ply the trash cans and sewers of a Parisian suburb, just like good rats should. ""Eat your garbage!"" commands Remy\'s father, Django, obviously a loving parent. The rats are evicted from their cozy home in a cottage-kitchen ceiling in a scene that will have rat-haters in the audience cringing (and who among us will claim they don\'t hate rats more than a little?), and they are swept through the sewers in a torrential flood. Students of Victor Hugo will know that the hero Jean Valjean of Les Miserables found the Seine because he knew that every sewer must necessarily run downhill toward it, and indeed Remy washes up near the river, in view of the most famous restaurant in tout le France. This is the establishment of Auguste Gusteau, author of the best-seller Anyone Can Cook, a title that might not go over very well in France, which is why the book appears to be in English, and might well be titled, Anyone Can Cook Better Than the English. (Famous British recipe: ""Cook until gray."")', 'Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) has always been blessed, or cursed, with a refined palate and a sensitive nose, and now he starts skulking around the kitchen of Gusteau, his culinary hero (voice of Brad Garrett). Alas, when the monstrous food critic Anton Ego (Peter O\'Toole) issues a scathing indictment of Gusteau\'s recent cooking, the chef dies in a paroxysm of grief or perhaps it is not a paroxysm, but I like the word, and the kitchen is taken over by the sniveling little snipe Skinner (Ian Holm). Lowest of the low is Gusteau\'s ""nephew"" Linguini (Lou Romano), who must be hired, but is assigned to the wretched job of plongeur -- literally, one who washes the dishes by plunging them into soapy water.', ""Linguini and Remy meet, somehow establish trust and communication, and when Linguini gets credit for a soup that the rat has saved with strategic seasonings, they team up. Remy burrows into Linguini's hair, is concealed by his toque, can see through its transparent sides and controls Linguini by pulling on his hair as if each tuft were a joystick. Together, they astonish Paris with their genius."", 'All of this begins as a dubious premise and ends as a triumph of animation, comedy, imagination and, yes, humanity. What is most lovable about Remy is his modesty and shyness, even for a rat. He has body language so expressive than many humans would trade for it. Many animated characters seem to communicate with semaphores, but Remy has a repertory of tiny French hand gestures, shrugs and physical expressiveness. Does any other nationality have more ways of moving a finger and an eyebrow less than an inch while signaling something as complex as, ""I would do anything for you, monsieur, but as you see, I have only two hands, and these times we live in do not permit me the luxury of fulfilling such requests.""', 'Brad Bird and his executive producer, John Lasseter, clearly have taken over the leadership in the animation field right now. Yes, Bird made ""The Incredibles,"" but the one that got away was his wonderful ""The Iron Giant,"" in which a towering robot was as subtle, gentle and touching as Remy. His eye for detail is remarkable. Every prop and utensil and spice and ingredient in the kitchen is almost tangible, and I for one would never turn off the Food Channel if Remy hosted a program named ""Any Rat Can Cook.""', 'This is clearly one of the best of the year\'s films. Every time an animated film is successful, you have to read all over again about how animation isn\'t ""just for children"" but ""for the whole family,"" and ""even for adults going on their own.""

These days, “season” seems to have lost its meaning, though I do understand that this now can refer to a production cycle. In the case of the fifth season of Adventure Time, episodes were spread out between November 2012 and March 2014, comprising 52 quarter-hour episodes, making it twice as long as previous seasons.

The bizarre show with strange appeal not only kept its ratings higher than ever, it also won Emmy awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Animation in both 2013 and 2014.

He stayed with the series, however, still contributing as writer and storyboard artist. Ward’s pal from CalArts, Adam Muto, took his place as showrunner.

Back in the old days, shows began their seasons in September, ended in the spring, and ran reruns over the summer. For cartoon shows, seasons were shorter, so the reruns came up a lot quicker. These days, “season” seems to have lost its meaning, though I do understand that this now can refer to a production cycle. In the case of the fifth season of Adventure Time, episodes were spread out between November 2012 and March 2014, comprising 52 quarter-hour episodes, making it twice as long as previous seasons. Fortunately for fans, the quality did not dip at all. The bizarre show with strange appeal not only kept its ratings higher than ever, it also won Emmy awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Animation in both 2013 and 2014. So, it won the same award twice for what was really the same season. For a show so unconventional, I guess that seems about right.', 'This was also the season in which creator Pendleton Ward quit as the series’ showrunner. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the native of San Antonio described how the series was eating up all his time and wearing him out, with the situation becoming more dire as the show increased in popularity and spawned countless merchandised products that also required some level of his input. For a proclaimed introvert, it all became too much. Ward wanted to reclaim his life, and just be creative, without the pressures of running a show and an empire. He stayed with the series, however, still contributing as writer and storyboard artist. Ward’s pal from CalArts, Adam Muto, took his place as showrunner. Given their long-standing friendship, and Ward’s ongoing involvement in the show, fans could rest easy, knowing Adventure Time was still in good hands.', 'When Season Four ended, our heroes were chasing The Lich, when they entered a dimensional portal and were transported to an alternate reality. The season finale was notable for switching art styles at the very end, with Jake and Finn living on a farm, and Jake apparently existing as a normal dog. This situation is rectified in the two-part opener for Season Five, Finn The Human', 'There are far too many episodes in this two-disc set to go over each one, even briefly. Many stories stand out, however, for various reasons. I liked the concept of miniature versions of Finn’s friends in All The Little People', 'We hear more from the gender-bent Fiona and Cake in Bad Little Boy, wherein Marceline’s male counterpart Marshall Lee plays a role. Flame Princess stories are always welcome, and in Vault Of Bones we see her come to terms with her apparent evilness; later, she is tricked by Finn, in the status quo-changing Frost & Fire, then goes up against her father in Earth & Water, and battles him again in The Red Throne', 'And that doesn’t even touch on evil goblin kings, The Ice King’s penguin henchman Gunter as a princess, a sentient female island, Jake’s old gang, BMO’s backstory, another Marceline and Princess Bubblegum adventure, the return of The Green Lady from Season Three, Slime Princess’ quest for a husband, Banana Man, and Ice King moving in with Finn and Jake. And so much more craziness.', 'The fifth season was notable for bringing on guest collaborators to produce animation, which was normally done in South Korea. David O’Reilly directed A Glitch Is A Glitch in his inimitable 3D style, telling a tale of The Ice King’s destructive computer virus. Additionally, famed animator James Baxter (he did Belle in Beauty And The Beast, among many other characters for Disney and DreamWorks), agreed to animate the horse in James Baxter The Horse, an idea borne out of a CalArts lecture he had given years earlier.', 'Some fans have called this the best season yet. I’m not sure about that. The series has always been loopy and creative, with deeper elements sneaking in periodically. But this sure isn’t a step down. Adventure Time remains one of the most interesting and strangest shows on television, able to captivate all ages in a genius blend of humour, melancholy, and triumph.', 'The three previous seasons on disc had audio commentaries on every episode (Season One had only four), but this time around there are none at all. The set’s one substantial feature is Adventure Time Forever', 'In place of commentaries, there are animatics (filmed storyboards, with soundtrack) for each episode. These are not complete episodes, only scenes from them, running about a minute or less.', 'The first disc runs a couple of DVD ads, including those for Uncle Grandpa: Good Morning, and Clarence: Mystery Pinata.', 'Warner Home Video continues with the motif of big heads with die-cut cover slips, featuring Jake this time. (The actual case cover shows Jake eating a sandwich.) The case has a disc on each side, with an insert with an UltraViolet code, and another insert that helpfully has a list of episodes.', 'There would be no excuse for this digitally painted show not to look fantastic on Blu-ray, and fortunately, it doesn’t need any. Character designs may be odd and simple on this show. But the colors are beautiful to look at on a big screen. Oh, there is minor banding on rare occasions, but this is certainly better than many of you get on broadcast.', 'Warner sticks with plain ‘ol Dolby Stereo with this release, just as they offered on previous seasons. However, while it could be argued that the audio lacks the “oomph” that a lossless track could offer, there is nothing particularly wrong with what we get either. If anything, I’d prefer to get a full 5.1 track instead (sorry to be repeating myself, but broadcast gets 5.1, and Blu-ray purchasers expect the same). Subtitles are available in English for the hearing impaired.', 'The Cartoon Network smash keeps chugging along with another gleefully surreal season of quirky characters, strange romance, weird ideas, a bit of history, and— of course— adventures. Specs are the same as before, for better or worse, but this time we get twice as many episodes, over nine hours of mathematical storytelling. The bonus material comes up short this time, but the extended run time makes up for it. At this point, the creators seem a long ways off from running out of steam, assuring that my kids and I will be following Finn and Jake for a while.', '\n\nYou may be interested in these related articles:\n Adventure Time: The Complete Fourth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Sixth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Seventh Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete First And Second Seasons\nAdventure Time: Islands\n\n\n\n', 'You may be interested in these related articles:\n Adventure Time: The Complete Fourth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Sixth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Seventh Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete First And Second Seasons\nAdventure Time: Islands\n\n\n', '\n Adventure Time: The Complete Fourth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Sixth Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete Seventh Season\nAdventure Time: The Complete First And Second Seasons\nAdventure Time: Islands\n\n\n', '\nHow would you rate it?\n \xa0 10.00/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n', '\n \xa0 10.00/10\r\nYour score:  \r\nMove your mouse along the score bar aboveand then click to cast your vote.\n']" "[' Animation', ' Adventure', ' Comedy', ' Family', ' Fantasy', ' Sci-Fi']" "Adventure Time"

On earlier viewings I was caught up by the boundless imagination of the story. This time I began to focus on the elements in the picture that didn\'t need to be there. Animation is a painstaking process, and there is a tendency to simplify its visual elements. Miyazaki, in contrast, offers complexity. His backgrounds are rich in detail, his canvas embraces space liberally, and it is all drawn with meticulous attention. We may not pay much conscious attention to the corners of the frame, but we know they are there, and they reinforce the remarkable precision of his fantasy worlds.', '""Spirited Away"" is surely one of the finest of all animated films, and it has its foundation in the traditional bedrock of animation, which is frame-by-frame drawing. Miyazaki began his career in that style, but he is a realist and has permitted the use of computers for some of the busywork. But he personally draws thousands of frames by hand. ""We take handmade cell animation and digitize it in order to enrich the visual look,"" he told me in 2002, ""but everything starts with the human hand drawing.""', 'Consider a scene in ""Spirited Away"" where his young heroine stands on a bridge leading away from the magical bathhouse in which much of the movie is set. The central action and necessary characters supply all that is actually needed, but watching from the windows and balconies of the bathhouse are many of its occupants. It would be easier to suggest them as vaguely moving presences, but Miyazaki takes care to include many figures we recognize. All of them are in motion. And it isn\'t the repetitive motion of much animation, in which the only idea is simply to show a figure moving. It is realistic, changing, detailed motion.', 'Most people watching the movie will simply read those areas of the screen as ""movement."" But if we happen to look, things are really happening there. That\'s what I mean by generosity and love. Mikayazi and his colleagues care enough to lavish as much energy on the less significant parts of the frame. Notice how much of the bathhouse you can see. It would have been quicker and easier to show just a bridge and a doorway. But Miyazaki gives his bathhouse his complexity of a real place, which possesses attributes whether or not the immediate story requires them.', 'The story of ""Spirited Away"" has been populated with limitless creativity. Has any film ever contained more different kinds of beings that we have never seen anywhere before? Miyazaki\'s imagination never rests. There is a scene where the heroine and her companion get off a train in the middle of a swamp. In the distant forest they see a light approaching. This turns out to be an old-fashioned light pole that is hopping along on one foot. It bows to them, turns, and lights the way on the path they must take. When they arrive at a cottage, it dutifully hangs itself above the gate. The living light pole is not necessary. It is a gift from Miyazaki.', 'His story involves a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro, who isn\'t one of those cheerful little automatons that populate many animated films. She is described by many critics as ""sullen."" Yes, and impatient and impetuous, as she\'s stuck in the back seat during a long drive to a house her parents want to examine. Her father loses the way in a dark forest, and the road seems to end at the entrance to a tunnel. Investigating it, they find it leads to an abandoned amusement park. But at dusk, some of the shops seem to reopen, especially a food shop whose fragrances steam into the cool air. Her parents fall eagerly upon the counter jammed with food, and stuff their mouths. Chihiro is stubborn and says she isn\'t hungry. Her parents eat so much they double or triple in size. They eat like pigs, and they become pigs. These aren\'t the parents of American animation, but parents who can do things that frighten a child.', 'The amusement park leads to a gigantic floating bathhouse, whose turrets and windows and ledges and ornamentation pile endlessly upon themselves. A friendly boy warns her to return, but she is too late, and the bathhouse casts off from the shore. Chihiro ventures inside, and finds a world of infinite variety. She cannot find her way out again. The boy says everyone must have a job, and sends her to Kamaji, an old bearded man with eight elongated limbs, who runs the boiler room. He and a young girl advise her to apply to Yubaba, who owns the bathhouse. This is a fearsome old witch who exhales plumes of smoke and a cackling laugh.', ""This is the beginning of an extraordinary adventure. Chihiro will meet no more humans in the bathhouse. She will be placed under a spell by Yubaba, who steals her name and gives her a new one, Sen. Unless she can get her old name back again, she can never leave. One confusing space opens onto another in the bathhouse, whose population is a limitless variety of bizarre life-forms. There are little fuzzy black balls with two eyeballs, who steal Sen's shoes. Looming semi-transparent No Faces, who wear masks over their ghostly shrouds. Three extraordinary heads without bodies, who hop about looking angry, and resemble caricatures of Karl Marx. There is a malodorous heap of black slime, a river creature whose body has sopped up piles of pollution. Shape-shifting, so common in Japanese fantasy, takes place here, and the boy who first befriended her is revealed as a lithe sea dragon with fierce fangs."", 'Sen makes her way through this world, befriended by some, shunned by others, threatened by Yubaba, learning as she goes. She never becomes a ""nice girl,"" but her pluck and determination win our affection. She becomes determined to regain her name and return to the mainland on a daily train (which only runs one way). She wants to find her parents again.', 'Miyazaki says he made the film specifically for 10-year-old girls. That is why it plays so powerfully for adult viewers. Movies made for ""everybody"" are actually made for nobody in particular. Movies about specific characters in a detailed world are spellbinding because they make no attempt to cater to us; they are defiantly, triumphantly, themselves. As I watched the film again, I was spellbound as much as by any film I consider great. That helps explain why ""Spirited Away"" grossed more than ""Titanic"" in Japan, and was the first foreign film in history to open in the U. S. having already made more than $200 million.', 'I was so fortunate to meet Miyazaki at the 2002 Toronto film festival. I told him I love the ""gratuitous motion"" in his films; instead of every movement being dictated by the story, sometimes people will just sit for a moment, or sigh, or gaze at a running stream, or do something extra, not to advance the story but only to give the sense of time and place and who they are.', '""We have a word for that in Japanese,"" he said. ""It\'s called \'ma.\' Emptiness. It\'s there intentionally."" He clapped his hands three or four times. ""The time in between my clapping is \'ma.\' If you just have non-stop action with no breathing space at all, it\'s just busyness.""', 'I think that helps explain why Miyazaki\'s films are more absorbing than the frantic action in a lot of American animation. ""The people who make the movies are scared of silence"" he said, ""so they want to paper and plaster it over,"" he said. ""They\'re worried that the audience will get bored. But just because it\'s 80 percent intense all the time doesn\'t mean the kids are going to bless you with their concentration. What really matters is the underlying emotions--that you never let go of those.', '""What my friends and I have been trying to do since the 1970\'s is to try and quiet things down a little bit; don\'t just bombard them with noise and distraction. And to follow the path of children\'s emotions and feelings as we make a film. If you stay true to joy and astonishment and empathy you don\'t have to have violence and you don\'t have to have action. They\'ll follow you. This is our principle.""', 'He said he has been amused to see a lot of animation in live-action superhero movies. ""In a way, live action is becoming part of that whole soup called animation. Animation has become a word that encompasses so much, and my animation is just a little tiny dot over in the corner. It\'s plenty for me.""', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

This is the new animated feature by John Lasseter (""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug\'s Life""); it tells a bright and cheery story, and then has a little something profound lurking around the edges. In this case, it\'s a sense of loss.', ""What have we lost? Its hero, a racing car named Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), has just lost a big race, and then one day on the highway he goes astray, and rolls into the forgotten hamlet of Radiator Springs, in Carburetor County. This was a happenin' town, back when Route 66 was the way to get from Chicago to L.A., passing through Flagstaff, Arizona, and don't forget Winona. But now the interstates and time itself have passed it by, and the town slumbers on, a memory of an earlier America."", 'Lightning\'s dream is to win the Piston Cup, the grand prix of American racing. He\'s on his way to the race when he gets lost, and then, more humiliating, impounded. Once released, he meets the population of Radiator Springs, led by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), who may be an old-timer but probably knows something about Hudsons that Lightning doesn\'t: Because of their ""step-down design,"" they had a lower center of gravity than the Big 3 models of its time and won stock car races by making tighter turns.', ""Other citizens include Mater (rhymes with tow-mater) the Tow Truck (voice of Larry the Cable Guy), Sally the sexy Porsche (Bonnie Hunt), Fillmore the hippie VW bug (George Carlin), and Sarge the veteran Jeep (Paul Dooley). Tractors serve as the cows of Radiator Springs, and even chew their cud, although what that cud consists of I'm not sure. Fan belts, maybe."", 'The message in ""Cars"" is simplicity itself: Life was better in the old days, when it revolved around small towns where everybody knew each other, and around small highways like Route 66, where you made new friends, sometimes even between Flagstaff and Winona. This older America has long been much-beloved by Hollywood, and apparently it survives in Radiator Springs as sort of a time capsule.', ""Doc Hudson, it turns out, was a famous race car in his day. That leads up to a race in which the vet and the kid face off, although how that race ends I would not dream of revealing. What I will reveal, with regret, is that the movie lacks a single Studebaker. The 1950s Studebakers are much beloved by all period movies, because they so clearly signal their period, from the classic Raymond Loewy-designed models to the Golden Hawk, which left Corvettes and T-Birds eating its dust. Maybe there's no Hawk in Radiator Springs because then Doc Hudson would lose his bragging rights."", ""The movie is great to look at and a lot of fun, but somehow lacks the extra push of the other Pixar films. Maybe that's because there's less at stake here, and no child-surrogate to identify with. I wonder if the movie's primary audience, which skews young, will much care about the 1950s and its cars. Maybe they will. Of all decades, the 1950s seems to have the most staying power; like Archie and Jughead, the decade stays forever young, perhaps because that's when modern teenagers were invented."", 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?

And if it\'s as successful as I suspect it will be, it could shake American studio animation out of the doldrums it\'s been mired in for years. It avoids a lot of the cliched visuals and storytelling beats that make even the best Pixar movies, and a lot of movies by Pixar\'s competitors, feel too familiar. The best parts of it feel truly new, even as they channel previous animated classics (including the works of Hayao Miyazaki) and explore situations and feelings that everyone has experienced to some degree.', 'The bulk of the film is set inside the brain of young \r\nRiley (Kaitlyn Dias), who\'s depressed about her mom and dad\'s decision to \r\nmove them from Minnesota to San Francisco, separating her from her friends. Riley\'s emotions are determined by the interplay of five overtly \r\n""cartoonish"" characters: Joy (Amy Poehler), a slender sprite-type who \r\nlooks a little bit like Tinkerbell without the wings; Sadness (Phyllis \r\nSmith), who\'s soft and blue and recessive; Fear (Bill Hader), a scrawny, purple,\r\nbug-eyed character with question-mark posture; Disgust (Mindy Kaling), \r\nwho\'s a rich green, and has a bit of a ""Mean Girls"" vibe; and Anger\r\n (Lewis Black), a flat-topped fireplug with devilish red skin and a middle-manager\'s nondescript slacks, fat tie and short-sleeved shirt. \r\nThere\'s a master control room with a board that the five major emotions \r\njostle against each other to control. Sometimes Joy is the dominant \r\nemotion, sometimes Fear, sometimes Sadness, etc., but never to the \r\nexclusion of the others. The controller hears what the other emotions are saying, and\r\n can\'t help but be affected by it.', 'The heroine\'s memories are represented by softball-sized spheres that are color-coded by dominant emotion (joy, sadness, fear and so forth), shipped from one mental location to another through a sort of vacuum tube-type system, then classified and stored as short-term memories or long-term memories, or tossed into an ""abyss"" that serves the same function here as the trash bin on a computer. (""Phone numbers?"" grouses a worker in Riley\'s memory bank. ""We don\'t need these. They\'re in her phone!"") Riley\'s mental terrain has the jumbled, brightly colored, vacu-formed design of mass market toys or board games, with touches that suggest illustrated books, fantasy films (including Pixar\'s) and theme parks aimed at vacationing families (there are ""islands"" floating in mental space, dedicated to subjects that Riley thinks about a lot, like hockey). There\'s an imaginary boyfriend, a nonthreatening-teen-pop-idol type\r\n who proclaims, ""I would die for Riley. I live in Canada.""\xa0 A ""Train of Thought"" that carries us through Riley\'s subconscious evokes one of those miniature trains you ride at zoos; it chugs through the air on rails that materialize in front of the train and disintegrate behind it. ', 'The story kicks into gear when Riley attends her new school on the first day of fifth grade and flashes back to a memory that\'s color-coded as ""joyful,"" but ends up being reclassified as ""sad"" when Sadness touches it and causes Riley to cry in front of her classmates. Sadness has done this once before; she and Joy are the two dominant emotions in the film. This makes sense when you think about how nostalgia—which is what Riley is mostly feeling as she remembers her Minnesota past—combines these two feelings. A struggle between Joy and Sadness causes ""core memories"" to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed up, along with the two emotions, and spat into the wider world of Riley\'s emotional interior. The rest of the film is a race to prevent these core memories from being, basically, deleted. Meanwhile, back at headquarters, Fear, Anger and Disgust are running the show. ', 'It\'s worth pointing out here that all these characters and locations, as well as the supporting players that we meet\r\n inside Riley\'s brain, are figurative. They are visual representations of ineffable sensations, a bit like the characters and symbols on Tarot cards. And this is where ""Inside Out"" differs strikingly from other Pixar features. it is not, strictly speaking, fantasy or science fiction, categories that describe the rest of the company\'s output. It\'s more like an extended dream that interprets itself as it goes along, and it\'s rooted in reality. The world beyond Riley\'s mind looks pretty much like ours, though of course it\'s represented by stylized, computer-rendered drawings. Nothing happens there that could not happen in our world. Most of the action is of a type that a studio executive would call ""low stakes"": Riley struggles through her first day at a new school, gets frustrated by her mom and dad pushing her to buck up, storms to her room and pouts, etc. ', ""The script draws clear connections between what happens to Riley in San Francisco (and what happened to her when she was little) and the figurative or metaphorical representations of those same experiences that we see inside her mind, a parallel universe of fond memories, repressed pain, and slippery associations. The most endearing and heartrending moments revolve around Bing-Bong (Richard Kind), the imaginary friend that Riley hasn't thought about in years. He's a creature of pure benevolence who only wants Riley to have fun and be happy. His body is made of cotton candy, he has a red wagon that can fly and that leaves a rainbow trail, and his serene acceptance of his obsolescence gives him a heroic dimension. He is a Ronin of positivity who still pledges allegiance to the Samurai that released him years ago. "", 'Written by Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley from a story by Ronnie del Carmen and Pete Docter, and directed by \r\nDocter\xa0(""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Up""), ""Inside Out"" has the intricate interplay of image and sound that you\'ve come to expect from \r\nPixar.\xa0It also boasts the company\'s characteristic, three-leveled humor \r\naimed at, respectively, very young children, older kids and adults, and \r\npop culture buffs who are always on the lookout for a clever homage (a \r\nseparate class of obsessive). There\'s nothing quite like hearing a theater packed with people laughing at the same gag for different reasons. A scene where Bing-Bong, Joy and Sadness race to catch the Train of Thought is exciting for all, thanks to the elegant way it\'s staged, and funny mainly because of the way Poehler, Smith and Kind say the lines. But adults will also appreciate the no-fuss way that it riffs on poetic and psychological concepts, and aficionados of the histories of animation and fine art will dig how the filmmakers tip their hats to other artistic schools. The characters get to Imagination Land by taking a shortcut through Abstract Thought, which turns them into barely-representational characters with smashed-up Cubist features, then mutates them into flat figurines that suggest characters in a 1960s short film by UPA, or an animation company based in Eastern Europe. There are very sly throwaway gags as well, like a character\'s comment that facts and opinions look ""so similar,"" and a pair of posters glimpsed in a studio where dreams and nightmares are produced: ""I\'m Falling For a Very Long Time Into a Pit"" and ""I Can Fly!""', 'It\'s clear that the filmmakers have studied actual psychology, not the Hollywood movie version. The script initially seems as if it\'s favoring Joy\'s interpretation of what things mean, and what the other emotions ought to ""do"" for Riley. But soon we realize that Sadness has just as much of value to contribute, that Anger, Fear and Disgust are useful as well, and that none of them should be prized to the exclusion of the rest. The movie also shows how things can be remembered with joy, sadness, anger, fear or disgust, depending on where we are in the narrative of our lives and what part of a memory we fixate on. There\'s a great moment late in the story where we ""swipe"" through one of Riley\'s most cherished memories and see that it\'s not just sad or happy: it\'s actually very sad, then less sad, then finally happy. We might be reminded of Orson Welles\' great observation, ""If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story."" ', ""The film is even more remarkable for how it presents depression: so subtly but unmistakably that it never has to label it as depression. Riley is obviously depressed, and has good reason to be. The abyss where her core memories have been dumped is also a representation of depression. True to life, Riley stays in her personal abyss until she's ready to climb out of it. There's no magic cure that will make the pain go away. She just has to be patient, and feel loved."", 'A wise friend told me years ago that we have no control over our emotions, only over what we choose to do about them, and that even if we know this, it can still be hard to make good decisions, because our feelings are so powerful, and there are so many of them fighting to be heard. ""Inside Out"" gets this. It avoids the sorts of maddening, self-serving, binary statements that kids always hate hearing their parents spout: Things aren\'t so bad. You can decide to be happy. Look on the bright side. Even as we root for Riley to find a way out of her despair, \r\nwe\'re never encouraged to think that she\'s just being childish, or that \r\nshe wouldn\'t be taking everything so seriously if she were older. We feel \r\nfor her, and with her. She contains multitudes.', 'Hey, ""Blade Runner 2049"": You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours?
