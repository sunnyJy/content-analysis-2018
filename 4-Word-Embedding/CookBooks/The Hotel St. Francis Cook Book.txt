 PREFACE 
 
In this, my book, I have endeavored to give expression to the art of cookery as developed in recent years in keeping with the importance of the catering business, in particular the hotel business, which, in America, now leads the world.
 
 
I have been fortunate in studying under the great masters of the art in Europe and America; and since my graduation as Chef I have made several journeys of observations to New York, and to England, France and Switzerland to learn the new in cooking and catering.
 
 
I have named my book The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book in compliment to the house which has given me in so generous measure the opportunity to produce and reproduce, always with the object of reflecting a cuisine that is the best possible.
 
 
The recipes in my book calling for wines and liqueurs for flavoring may be followed by those whose legitimate supplies are not used up; and where these cannot be had there are non-alcoholic substitutes available with the flavor near perfect. The juice of lemons will serve in many cases to give agreeable flavor.
 
 
The spaces left open in the pages of the book are for the purpose of affording convenient place for writing in additional recipes. The paper on which the book is printed is specially selected for this purpose.

Turn occasionally, using a fork to avoid breaking the vegetables. They should simmer without adding liquid, but should they be too dry, a half cup of  consomm&#233;  may be added.

 Bain-marie.  This is a term used in cookery for a vessel holding hot water in which another vessel may be heated at a temperature not above that of boiling water. Different dishes are variously allowed to stand, cook or bake in bain-marie. For example, Hollandaise sauce should be kept in bain-marie in hot water. Hollandaise or B&#233;arnaise sauce, if kept in boiling water, would turn. A cream soup should be kept in boiling water, as extra cooking will not harm it. Timbale of chicken, custard for soup, or cup custard, should be cooked in bain-marie.

 Stuffed breast of veal, au jus. Have your butcher prepare a  breast of veal  ready for  stuffing.  Use the same dressing as for  chicken,  and sew up the end so the dressing will not fall out while roasting. Put in the roasting pan one sliced  onion  and one  carrot.  Put in the  veal  and sprinkle with  salt and  pepper.  Put bits of  butter  all over the top and roast in oven, basting often. It will take about an hour to cook in a moderate oven. Remove the  veal  to platter when done, and make a  sauce  by adding to the  gravy  in pan one cup of bouillon and one spoonful of  meat extract,  boil for five minutes, and strain.
 
 
 
 
 Asparagus tips, au gratin. Put the tips in a buttered pan or silver dish, cover with well-seasoned  cream sauce,  sprinkle with  grated cheese  and small bits of  butter  and bake in oven until brown.

Cover and let it boil slowly until about three-quarters done. Then add two heads of well-washed  cabbage  cut in four, and cook with the  beef  for at least one hour.

 Russian salad. Equal parts of boiled  carrots,   turnips,   beets  and  potatoes,  cut in small dice, boiled  peas,  boiled  string beans  cut in small pieces, and one slice of cold  roast beef  cut in small squares. Put all in salad bowl, season with  salt,   pepper,  a little  Cayenne pepper,  and just enough  tarragon vinegar  to wet the mixture. Let stand for one hour, drain off the liquid, if any, and form the salad in pyramid shape in the bowl. Spread some thick  mayonnaise  over all, and garnish with boiled  potatoes and truffles,  cut like a five-cent piece, linking one to the other around the base of the salad like a chain. On top put a small flower of a boiled and seasoned  cauliflower,  and serve very cold.
 
 
 
 
 Caramel custard. Put two ounces of sugar  in a copper pan and cook until it is brown in color, then pour into a custard mould and allow to become cold. Mix four  eggs  with one-quarter of a pound of  sugar,  flavor with  vanilla,  add one pint of  milk,  and strain. Pour over the  burned sugar,  and fill the mould. Put in bain-marie and cook until firm. When cool, reverse the custard on a dish, and serve. The  caramel  at the bottom of the mould will serve as a  sauce.

Mix well and pour over the  tomatoes. 
 
 
 
 
 Sorrel.  Sorrel  is a fine vegetable for the promotion of health. Remove the stems from a peck of  sorrel  and wash the leaves in four different waters, to remove all the sand. Have a kettle with  salted water  on the fire. Put the  sorrel  into the  boiling water  and cook for ten minutes, stirring often. Pour off the water and let stand in the colander fifteen minutes so it will drain dry, then strain through a fine sieve. Then put the  sorrel  in a sauce pan with three ounces of  butter  and bring to the boiling point. Season with  salt  and  pepper,  and bind with two whole  eggs,  beaten. Do not let it boil after adding the  eggs,  but let it get just hot enough to give the  sorrel  a firm body. Garnish with the half of a  hard boiled egg,  if desired.

One pint of  milk,  one pint of  whipped cream,  the  yolks of four eggs,  one-quarter pound of  sugar,  six sheets of  French gelatine,  and one-half pint of  raspberry juice.  Boil the  milk  with the  sugar,  then pour over the  yolks,  and set on the fire again until it thickens, but do not let it boil. Wash the  gelatine  in  cold water,  add to the mixture, and stir until melted. Then set aside until cold. Mix the  raspberry pulp  with the  whipped cream,  ans stir into the mixture.

 Sauerkraut, Hungarian style. Put in a casserole one-quarter pound of  lard  and one pound of  sauerkraut.  Sprinkle on top one spoonful of  paprika  and three peeled and chopped  tomatoes.  Then add two pounds of  bacon  and another pound of  sauerkraut,  and sprinkle again with another spoonful of  paprika and three chopped  tomatoes.  Add a pint of  sweet white wine  and a pint of  bouillon,  and one  bouquet garni.  Cover and bake in oven for one hour and a half. Remove the bouquet garni, and serve with the  bacon  sliced.
 
 
 
 
 Special notice for sauerkraut. Avoid salt, as the  sauerkraut  is seasoned, and the  bacon  and  salt pork  are salty also. If the raw  sauerkraut  is too salty, lay it in a dish pan, cover with  water,  and squeeze out with the hands immediately. Do not let it remain in the  water  but a second.
 
 
Other  meats  may be cooked in the  sauerkraut,  as  beef  and  pork  together,  lamb  and  pork,   beef  and  lamb,  or  pheasant  or other  game.

When the boiling point is reached add two whole  carrots,  two  turnips,  three stalks of  leeks,  one stalk of  celery,  a bouquet garni, one small  head  of Savoy cabbage,  and two large  onions,  all well washed. Bring to the boiling point again, cover, and put on the side of the stove where it will simmer slowly. The vegetables will be done before the  meat,  so when they are cooked remove them and throw out the bouquet garni. Let the  beef cook until very soft. Cut the vegetables, with the exception of the onions,  in thin slices; and when the  beef  is done strain the broth  over the vegetables. Give it another boil, season well, add some chopped chervil, and serve with  toasted bread  crusts, separate.

Finally squeeze in the  juice  of half a small  lemon.  If  crab  is used, cut the meat  in small pieces, and make the  sauce  in the same manner, but instead of beginning with the  juice of oysters  for the foundation of the sauce,  begin with a cup and a half of  cream  and  water in equal proportions, thicken with  corn starch,  then add the  yolks of eggs,  etc., as above. The  oysters  or the  crab meat  should be added last.

 Suggestions and recipes for preserves,  jellies  and  pickles.  For jelly select your fruit  before it is too ripe, as the flavor will then be much better. Put it on the stove and bring to a heat, to facilitate the easy extraction of the juice.  Have a funnel-shaped bag made of flannel, to strain the juice  through. The first time it is strained use a wire sieve with a revolving wire to crush the  fruit.  The  juice  should always be strained twice, and the second time if the flannel bag is used, and it is allowed to hang over night and drip, it will be much clearer. Put on the juice  over a good fire and allow it to come to a heat, then add the sugar,  which should be first heated in the oven. Boil rapidly in a pan with a very large bottom, so that as much surface can be on the stove as possible. If it is desired that the color be light add a little gelatine. From fifteen to twenty minutes is long enough to boil it, but it should not stop boiling during this time. Better success will probably be had if the jelly  is cooked in small quantities. After pouring the jelly  in glasses set in the hot sun until set, and then cover with melted paraffine.
 
 
If  corn starch  be put in the  juice  before adding the sugar  it will make it clearer. Use two teaspoonfuls in two tablespoonfuls of  water,  to three pints of  juice.  A teaspoonful of  sugar  on top of  jelly,  in the glass, prevents moulding. (To one pint of  juice  1 1/2 lbs.  sugar ).
 
 
  
 
 Preserves.  Small stone jars are best for preserves. If glass jars are used they should be wrapped in paper to exclude the light. To prevent preserves from sugaring add a little tartaric acid after they are cooked.
 
 
 
 
  Pickles.   Cider vinegar  is best for  pickles.  If  vinegar  is too strong dilute
 
it with  water.  The  pickles  should be tightly sealed to prevent the air reaching the  vinegar,  as this kills it. The vinegar  should always be poured on hot, just as it comes to the first scald--never allowing it to boil.
 
 
Never put up  pickles  in anything that has held  grease;  and never let them freeze. If  pickles  are put into  brine  it should be strong enough to  bear  an  egg.  To make the  brine,  use a heaping pint of  salt  to each gallon of  water.  Put the pickles  in bottles, and seal while the  brine  is hot. A half bushel of  grape leaves  added to the barrel of  salt pickles  will keep them sound and firm. A slice of  horseradish  added to each jar or bottle of  vinegar pickles  will keep the  vinegar  clear.

 Broiled honeycomb  tripe,   Chili sauce.  Roll four pieces of well seasoned boiled tripe in oil,  then in fresh  bread crumbs,  and then broil. Heat one-half bottle of  Chili sauce,  pour on a platter and lay the tripe  on top.
 
 
 
 
  Preserves.  Amount of fruit required. Seven and one-half pounds of  cherries and seven and one-half pounds of  sugar  will make one gallon of preserves. 
 
 
Fourteen pounds of  berries  and fourteen pounds of  sugar  will make five quarts of jam.
 
 
Two quarts of stemmed  currants  will make two pints of juice. Added to two pounds of  sugar  it will make three tumblers of jelly. 
 
 
Always wash  strawberries  before removing the hulls, and then put in a colander to drain. Always select  strawberries  for their flavor rather than for their size.
 
 
 
 
  Strawberry preserves.  Prepare a small quantity at a time to secure the best results. Make a  syrup  in a kettle with two pounds of  cane sugar  and half a cup of  water.  Drop the berries  into it and cook rapidly for twenty minutes. Do not stir, but remove any scum which may arise. After twenty
 
minutes remove the  berries  and put in tumblers. Cook the  syrup  to a  jelly  and fill up the tumblers with it. Allow to become cold before covering.
 
 
 
 
  Blackberry jam.  Four quarts of blackberries,  two quarts of nice cooked  apples,  four quarts of cane sugar.  Boil for twenty-five or thirty minutes.
 
 
 
 
  Raspberry  or  loganberry jam.  In making  raspberry jam,  if two-thirds  red raspberries  and one-third currants  are used the jam will be better, as the berries alone do not contain enough acid.  Loganberries  are sufficiently acid. Mash the fruit  well, and boil it for twenty minutes. Weigh, and to every pound of fruit  use three-quarters of a pound of sugar.  Boil until when some is placed on a saucer no  juice  will gather around it. Put in small jars or glasses, in the same manner as jelly. 
 
 
 
 
 Canned  strawberries.  Wash well before hulling. Weigh, and to each pound of  berries  add one-quarter pound of cane sugar.  Boil for fifteen minutes. Put in pint jars and seal while hot.
 
 
 
 
  Apple jelly.  Take ripe Belleflower, or other fine-flavored cooking  apples.  Cut in quarters and remove the cores. Drop in  water  as fast as cut, to prevent them from turning black. Add a little  lemon juice  to the  water.  When all are ready drain off the  water,  and put the  apples  in a copper preserving kettle. Pour a little  water  over them and cook until soft, then strain through a flannel bag. Boil the  juice  with an equal weight of  sugar,  until it jells, and pour while hot into  jelly  glasses.
 
 
 
 
  Blackberry jelly.  Heat the berries  to the boiling point, mash, and strain through a flannel bag. Add an equal weight of  sugar  to the  juice,  and boil briskly for twenty-five minutes. Pour into glasses while hot.

Remove from the fire and add half a vanilla bean,  then add slowly one gallon of  brandy.  When cold pour over the  cherries,  seal well, and keep in a cool place.
 
 
 
 
 Brandied  peaches.  Rub some sound white peaches  with a crash towel to remove the down. Prick all over with a needle, drop in  cold water,  drain, put in a kettle, cover with fresh cold water,  and add a small piece of  alum  the size of a hazelnut.  Place over a fire, stir occasionally, and as they float to the surface of the liquid take them out and place in a pan of cold water.  Drain, and arrange in quart glass jars. Pour over brandy enough to cover the  peaches. 
 
 
Seal and put away in a cool place, and let stand for two weeks. Then drain off  brandy  into a kettle, and allow three pounds of  sugar  to each gallon of  brandy.  Stir well to melt the  sugar.  Pour this over the peaches,  seal hermetically, and put away in a cool place.
 
 
 
 
  Preserved cherries.  To each pound of stoned  cherries  allow one pound of  granulated cane sugar.  Crack some of the stones and tie the kernels in a piece of gauze, so they may be removed after the boiling. Then put all in a preserving kettle, boil, and skim, until the  syrup  is clear. Then put the  cherries  in jars; boil the syrup  a little longer, and pour over the  fruit. 
 
 
 
 
  Preserved green gage plums.  Use a pound of  sugar  for each pound of  plums.  Have the  fruit  clean and dry, and prick all over to keep the  skins  from breaking. Melt the sugar  with as little  water  as possible, and when boiling add the plums,  a layer at a time. Boil for a few minutes, then lift out with a skimmer and place singly on a dish to cool. Continue in this way until the plums  are removed. When the last layer is finished return the first ones cooked to the kettle, and continue in reverse order, and boil until transparent. Then take out and arrange closely in glass jars. When all are in the jars pour the hot  syrup  over them, and seal.

  Watermelon preserves.  Select a melon  with a thick  rind,  and cut in any shape desired. Lay the pieces in strong  salt water  for two or three days; then soak in clear water  for twenty-four hours, changing the  water  frequently. Then put in  alum water  for two hours to harden. To every pound of fruit  use one pound of  sugar.  Make a  syrup  of the sugar  and a few pieces of  ginger root  and one  lemon  sliced thin. After boiling for a few minutes, remove the  lemon and ginger,  add the  melon,  and boil until transparent. Lift carefully, and place in glass jars. Fill the jars with the  syrup. 
 
 
 
 
 Canned  pears.  Peel, halve and core ten pounds of  pears.  Put in a vessel with five pounds of  granulated sugar,  one sliced  lemon,  one teaspoonful of ground  cinnamon, a little grated  nutmeg,  and a small piece of  ginger root.

 Canned  apples  and  quinces.  Pare and cut equal quantities of  apples  and
 
 quinces.  First cook the  quinces  in just sufficient  water  to cover. Then remove, and cook the  apples  in the same  water.  In a vessel put a layer of  quinces,  then a layer of  apples,  and so on until all are used. Pour over them a syrup made of half a pound of  sugar  for each pound of fruit;  and allow to stand over night. Then boil for five minutes, and seal in jars.
 
 
 
 
  Tomato preserves.  Scald and peel carefully some small,  pear -shaped, half ripe  tomatoes.  Prick with a needle to prevent their bursting, and put their weight in  sugar  over them. Let them set overnight, then pour off the liquid into a preserving kettle, and boil until it is a thick  syrup.  Clarify with the  white of an egg,  add the  tomatoes,  and boil until transparent. A small piece of  ginger root;  or a  lemon  sliced very thin, to each pound of fruit,  and cooked in the  syrup,  improves it.
 
 
 
 
  Apple butter.  To three gallons of cooked  apples  add one quart of  cider,  five pounds of  brown sugar,  and several sticks of  cinnamon.  Boil down to about two gallons.

Parboil four calf 's  feet;  allow to become cool; put back in vessel with an onion  and a  carrot,  a piece of  leek,  a piece of celery,  one  clove,  a  bay leaf,  a sprig of  thyme, a spoonful of whole  black peppers,  a gallon of  water,  a quart of white wine,  and a small handful of  salt.  Boil until the feet  are soft. Then strain the  broth,  let it stand for a couple of minutes, and then remove all the  fat  from the top. Put a spoonful of the  broth  on a plate and set on ice. If it sets too hard  add a little  water,  if it is too soft boil down until it is thick enough to set. Then put six  whites of eggs  in a casserole, beat with a whip,  add slowly to the  broth,  put on a slow fire and bring to the boiling point. This serves to clarify the  broth.  Then strain, and set to cool. If the  broth  is for invalids omit the  spices  and vegetables, use but a little  salt,  and do not clarify. The cooked calf 's  feet  may be used for an entr&#233;e, or for soup or salad.

 To  preserve limes.  Remove the cores from the  limes  with a small tin tube made for the purpose. Then cover with salad  water,  using a large handful of  salt  to the gallon. Soak for four or five hours; then drain off the  water,  and throw the limes  into  boiling water.  As soon as they are soft take them out, one by one, and drop them into  cold water.  Change the  cold water several times. To turn the  limes  green again put two gallons of water  in a copper pan, add two large handfuls of cooking salt, one cup of  vinegar,  and several handfuls of fresh spinach.  Put the pan on the fire and boil for a few minutes, then put the  limes  in the pan, and boil up several times. Remove from the fire, and allow to stand until cold; when the  limes  will have resumed their natural color. Drain off the liquid and let the  limes  soak in fresh water  for about fourteen hours, changing the  water frequently. Prepare a fifteen degree syrup,  testing with a  syrup gauge or cooking thermometer; and when boiling throw the  limes  into this, boil up, and then put into a vessel and leave for twelve hours. Then pour off the syrup,  and boil it to sixteen degrees, pour it over the limes again, leaving it for twelve hours. Then drain and boil again to twenty degrees, pour over the  limes, stand for twelve hours, and
 
continue every twelve hours until thirty-two degrees are reached. Then boil for two minutes, and pour into small stone jars. Seal hermetically when cool.

Then add three pounds of  granulated cane sugar  and the  currant juice,  after the gauze bag has been removed; and boil steadily until a little tried on a saucer will not spread. Add half a gill of kirschwasser, and pour at once into  jelly  glasses. Place in a cool place, and when cold pour melted paraffine over the top and cover tightly.
 
 
 
 
  Candied lemon  or  orange peels.  Put a sufficient quantity of  lemon or orange peels on the fire with enough  water  to cover. Boil until soft to the touch, then drain, and put in  cold water  and soak for twenty-four hours, changing the  water  often. Then pour off the  water,  and put the peels in an earthern jar, covering with a fifteen degree boiling  syrup. Use a syrup  gauge or cooking thermometer to determine the density. Let the peels stand for twelve hours, then pour off the  syrup  and boil it up to eighteen degrees. Pour again over the peels and let it set for twelve hours. Repeat this operation six or seven times, gradually increasing the density of the  syrup  until it reaches thirty-two degrees. The last time prepare a fresh thirty-two degree  syrup.  Drain the  old syrup  from the peels, add them to the fresh boiling  syrup,  and boil up once. Then put the peels in stone jars or pots, cover with the  syrup,  and seal when cold.

  Eggs  &#224; la Patti. Make a chicken  hash in  cream  and put on a platter. Lay four poached eggs  on top, and one slice of  truffle  on top of each egg. Pour  sauce  Mad&#232;re around the hash.
 
 
 
 
  puff paste  roses. Roll out some  puff paste  about one-eighth inch thick, and out with a star cutter. Brush over with a little  water,  and fold the points of the stars to the center. Bake, and when nearly done dust with  powdered sugar,  and return to oven to finish baking. The cakes will puff up like a rose. Fill with  jelly and serve.
 
 
 
 
 Consomm&#233; Alexandria. Add one cupful of boiled  white meat of chicken,  cut in small dices, to three pints of consomm&#233; brunoise.
 
 
 
 
  Orange  or  lemon brandy,  for flavoring. Peel very thin the yellow outside from oranges or lemons.  The inner  white skin  is not good. Crush with a little granulated sugar.  Put in a bottle and cover with strong brandy. In the same manner can be prepared the kernels of cherries,  plums,   apricots  or  peaches.  Pound the kernels slightly before putting them in the  brandy. 
 
 
 
 
 Glac&#233;  fruit.  Be very particular in selecting the  fruit.   Cherries  should be large and not quite ripe, and without blemishes; and the stones must be removed. Apricots and peaches  should be of medium size, and almost green. Make as small a hole as possible when removing the stones.  Pears  should be peeled, and the stems left on.  Figs  should be green. Strawberries  should be very green, but full grown; wash and dry well, and leave the stems on. Nectarines  should be green, and the stones removed. Any  hard green plums  may be used, but leave their stones in. Cut  pineapple  in thick slices, remove the core, and any brown outside spots. All  fruit  should be thoroughly washed and dried before being prepared. It is well to make new syrup  for each kind of  fruit.  To make the  syrup  boil two pounds of  granulated sugar  and two gills of  water  for eight minutes. Put the  fruit  in the  syrup piece by piece; do not let it stop boiling; and wait a few seconds between each piece, so the syrup will boil up over the  fruit.  Then remove piece by piece in the same order as placed in the kettle. Use a silver spoon or an aluminum skimmer to handle the  fruit,  and under no circumstances use a fork. Place the fruit  on
 
a thick piece of waxed paper,  and set in a cool place. Repeat the process the next day, adding a pound of  sugar  and a gill of  water  to the  syrup of the day before. Allow the  fruit  to boil  hard  for a minute, and remove as before. This must be continued for about eight days before the fruit will have absorbed enough  sugar,  and not be mushy. When the fruit is finished line a broad shallow stone jar with waxed paper, lay the fruit  in singly, not allowing the pieces to touch, put waxed paper  between the layers, and cover closely.
 
 
 
 
 Baked  pears,  for canning. Wash as many ripe, firm unspecked  pears  as will fill a baking pan. Fill the pan almost full of  boiling water.  Sweeten as though for immediate use. Set the pan in the oven, baste frequently, and turn the  pears  around so they will brown lightly and evenly. Add a few  cloves  and a small stick of cinnamon.  When the  pears  are very tender and almost candied, pack in hot glass jars, and pour the boiling  syrup  over them. Be sure to have enough thick  syrup  to cover the  fruit.  Seal while hot. Should the water  evaporate too much while cooking, add a little more from time to time.

   Scallops  &#224; la poulette. Parboil the   scallops  from two to three minutes in their own   juice,  but not longer, as they will become tough and rubbery. Drain, and keep the  juice.  Heat two spoonfuls of   flour  and two spoonfuls of  butter,  and add the   juice  and a little   stock,  making a thin   sauce.  Season with   salt  and   pepper,  add the   yolk of one egg  and two spoonfuls of   cream,  but do not boil. Mix in the  scallops,  and serve.   Oysters  and   clams  may be prepared in the same manner.
 
 
 
 
   Cranberry water  ice. Cook the  berries  in a very small quantity of   water  in a granite or porcelain lined kettle, as otherwise the   berries  will become discolored. Then strain the cooked   berries  through a hair-sieve, making a thin pur&#233;e. To every quart of   berries  add the juice of two  lemons.  For each quart of   berries  dissolve a pint of  sugar in a cup of   water,  and add to the pur&#233;e. Taste to see if sweet enough. Freeze in the same manner as other   water  ices. Serve as an ice, for dessert, or between courses; although the latter manner of serving ices is going out of vogue.

 Canap&#233; P. P. I. E. (Panama-Pacific International Exposition). Make some pieces of   buttered toast.  Put fresh  caviar  in the center and   anchovies  around the edge. Serve on napkins with quartered   lemons  and   parsley  in branches.
 
 
 
 
   Oysters  Bellevue. In a lighted chafing dish put four pats of table   butter,  one-half teaspoonful of English  mustard,  a little   salt,    pepper  and   celery salt. Stir until the   butter  melts. Then add a teacupful of very finely chopped  celery,  and stir well until the   celery  is nearly cooked. Then pour in slowly, while stirring, one pint of   rich cream,  and allow to come to the boiling point. Then put in a dozen freshly opened  oysters and cook for four or five minutes. Add a tablespoonful of good  sherry  or  Madeira,  and serve on very hot plates.
 
 
 
 
 Spoon or mush   bread.  Scald two cups of  corn meal  in two cups of   boiling water,  allow to cool slightly, then add one cup of   buttermilk,  one teaspoonful of   soda,  two tablespoonfuls of   lard  or   butter  (  butter  preferred), one  egg,  and   salt  to taste. If you have no  buttermilk use  baking powder  and   sweet milk. 
 
 
 
 
 Corn pudding. One quart of   corn  cut from the   ear  and chopped fine, one   egg,  a tablespoonful of  butter,  and   salt  and   pepper  to taste. Thin with   sweet milk,  and bake in a hot oven.

The  potatoes  in the west are not as sweet as the southern variety, therefore more   sugar may be required. A good rule is to bake a small portion first to see if the flavor is right. It is considered a luxury in certain parts of the South.
 
 
 
 
   Loganberry  ice   cream.  Put in a pan one quart of   milk  and one-half pound of   sugar,  and place on the fire. Mix the   yolks of sixteen eggs  with one-half pound of  sugar.

Then remove from the fire, add one quart of  cream,  strain and freeze. When nearly frozen add one quart of bottled  loganberry juice,  and finish freezing. A few drops of red coloring can be added if a bright color is desired.

 Boiled   beef  with vegetables. The  meat  should be juicy, well-flavored and tender. The brisket, cross  rib  and   rump  are the best portions. The wide  ribs  at the end of a   rib  roast are also very good. Tie the  beef  with a string and put into   boiling water;  clear from scum, add   salt,  and garnish with   carrots,   onions,   turnips,    celery,   leeks  and Savoy  cabbage.  The  cabbage  may be tied with a string to prevent disintegration. A good way is to put all the vegetables into a net as they can thus be withdrawn at once. Allow the   meat  to simmer gently on the side of the range, but do not let it come to a boil. When done cut in slices, not too thin, and garnish with the vegetables neatly arranged around the  beef.  Serve separately, either  cream horseradish sauce,  piquante,  tomato,  or bouillon  horseradish sauce.  A little of its own  broth  should be poured over the   meat  before serving.

   puff paste  crescents. Two pounds of  flour,  one pound of   butter,  one pint of   milk,  one ounce of  salt,  one and one-half ounces of   sugar  and two ounces of  yeast  dissolved in   warm water.  Mix one-half pound of the  flour  with one-half pint of   water  and the dissolved  yeast. Stand in warm place for about twenty minutes. Put the remainder of  flour on board and mix in the   yeast paste;  when sufficiently risen, add  salt,    sugar  and   milk,  make a stiff dough and allow to stand for a few minutes. Roll out, put the   butter into the dough as for ordinary   puff paste,  and roll in the same way, but giving it only half the number of turns.
 
 
 
 
   Stock  for soup. Two pounds of   beef bones  and a   marrow bone,  if you can obtain one, two gallons of  water,  a   carrot,    onion,    leek,  piece of  parsley,  a bouquet garni,   salt  and   pepper.  Boil for three hours. Strain.
 
 
 
 
   puff paste  (feuilletage). Take one pound of   flour  and one cup of   water  and make a smooth  paste,  but not too soft. Form into a square loaf and let it set for about fifteen minutes.

Fold the edges of the   paste  over the   butter  and roll out about one-quarter inch thick, taking care that the   butter  does not run out of the dough. Brush off the   flour  and fold in three. Roll out again to the same thickness as before and repeat the folding. Put in cool place or ice box for about one-half hour, then roll and fold as before. Again rest for one-half hour, and then roll and fold again. The   paste  will then have six turns in all, and after a little rest it can be used.
