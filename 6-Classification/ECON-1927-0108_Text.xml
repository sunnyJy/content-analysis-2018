			THE MONEY MARKET.
			As a result of the heavy market borrowing from the Bank of England last week there has been the usual plethora of floating credits in the first week of the New Year. to which the distribution of some 5 millions in Government interest has also contributed. and in the early part of the week balances were freely offered down to 2I per cent. Substantial repayments to the Bank began
			to have some effect towards the end of the week. but yesterday supplies of credits were still ample. The tone of the discount market has been weak. a strong demand for bills meeting with a comparatively small supply. The minimum for three months bills has generally been quoted at 41 per cent.. but the Continent is said to have been a buyer at 4-J per cent. The recent decline in the American and German exchanges has acted. however. as a steadying influence. Yesterday's Treasury bills were allotted at about-41 per cent.

			Thursday's Bank return showed an increase of 262.000 in the stock of coin and bullion. and a reduction of 981.700 in the note circulation. so that the Reserve expanded by 1.243.700. Owing to an increase in lia- bilities. however. the Proportion fell by 0.5 to 20.5 per cent. Further market borrowing at the year's end is reflected in an increase of 6.544.300 in Other securi- ties. while Government securities were increased by i.-930.100. Public deposits fell by 105.700. and Other deposits were thus 9.714.500 higher. Currency notes were reduced by 5.291.800 to 291.-169.000. which in- cludes 1.287.100 for notes called in but not yet cancelled. The fiduciary issue is 233.631.900. or 12.379.100 below the maximum for 1927. NEW YORK MARKETS. Our New York correspondent cables-o -The share market is highly irregular with New Year realisations and short selling mixed with bull campaigns. The turn- over is moderate and the public rather indifferent. The bond market. however. is strong on re-investing and the usual early January relaxation in the money market. The industrial news is indecisive and market sentiment is mixed. despite the year-end optimism of financial leaders. Dun's index number is unchanged. and Brad- street's is 0.3 per cent. higher during December. thus continuing the noteworthy stability of the last six months. The Federal Reserve statements reveal the usual January drop in the System's discounts with a flow of funds from New York. The ratio for the System is 71 per cent. THE STOCK MARKETS. Business in the stock markets in the first week of the New Year has not shown any noteworthy expansion. and price movements have been somewhat irregular. The early closing of the lists for the new 4-per cent. Con- solidated Stock stimulated the market for British Govern- ment stocks. but events in China depressed Chinese bonds. while weakness in the new Bulgarian scrip spread to other European issues. Home rails are dull on dividend uncertainties. but Argentine rails have been good. The rubber and oil share markets have shown a better tendency. Dunlops have rallied on dividend expec- tations. but tobaccos have reacted. Iron and steel shares are erratic. the shipping group is quiet. and British banks have hardened on the dividend announcements. The Kaffir market is strong. the feature being Sub Nigels. but Malayan tin shares have suffered from news of floods. The issue of 1.200.000 7 per cent. preference shares and 200.000 ordinary shares by the Drapery Trust was over- subscribed. THE COMMODITY MARKETS. Business has been distinctly more active this week. Buyers in the coal trade continue to hold off for lower prices. and production is also affected by a continued wagon shortage. More blast furnaces have been re- started. but pig-iron supplies available in the open market
			are still insufficient to meet demand. Steelmakers have large order books. and prices are firm. A larger business has been done in cotton. the revival of demand for India being a noteworthy feature on the textile side. Wool is steady. and more inquiries have been received for piece- goods. Wheat prices continue easy for most varieties. Sugar is quiet. coffee steady. and for the finer qualities of tea competition has been brisk. The rubber market is firmer. with a fair amount of business passing. Tin. copper. and lead have all declined. owing to pressure by sellers. FOREIGN EXCHANGES. The foreign exchange market was on the quiet side during the week. the feature being the continued weak- ness of the Reichsmark. and the evidence of a weaken- ing tendency in the franc and the lira at the close. The dollar rate opened on December 31st at 4.-850.-13-32. and was weaker next day at 4.85-50-1. where it remained on Monday. On Tuesday the rate improved to 4-850-. but it was back again on Wednesday to 4.851-. On Thursday it was again lower at 4.850-. and remained at that level yesterday. Paris was fairly steady through- out at a little below 123. but was weaker yesterday at rather over 123. and the widening of forward rates to 20f discount. as against 2f previously. is. perhaps. the writing on the wall. The belga also was weaker at 34.90-91 on Thursday and 34.89-90 yesterday. as com- pared-with the opening of 34.88-880. The lira opened at 108 on December 31st. and gradually tailed off to not on Thursday. after improvement to 1071 on Saturday and Monday. Yesterday it closed at no. The Reichs- mark opened with a weakish tendency at 20.-40 on January ist. which was confirmed by the rate moving steadily up to 20.45 yesterday. after an improvement to 20.39 momentarily on Monday. The gold exchanges Amsterdam. Stockholm. and Switzerland were fairly steady. with Switzerland moving slightly in our favour and Stockholm in the opposite direction. Oslo im- proved from 19.16 at the opening to 19.03 yesterday. Copenhagen was steady throughout at about 18.19 Athens closed better on balance at 381. and Bucharest I rather worse at 922-928. The peseta improved errati- cally during the week from 31.7S to 31.16 yesterday for no apparent cause. Other European currencies call for J no remark. Of the South American exchanges. both 1 Buenos Aires and Rio showed weakness. with a tendency to recover at the close. Rio standing yesterday at 5-J-jt and Buenos Aires at 46 9-32. In the Far East the yen was fractionally weaker at 2S o 7-32d. and the rupee fairly steady throughout at about is 6d. The silver market was decidedly quiet. and. with China. India. and the U.S.A. all selling. the market showed some weakening of prices in the early stages. At the close. however. a suggestion of further buying under the Pittman Act brought a rally. and prices closed only -fad lower on balance for spot. The China exchanges showed little movement. Hong- kong being rather better at is nfd. against an opening of is IId. Shanghai unchanged at 2s 4fd. and Singa- pore also unchanged at the same level.

			WEALTH AND POLITICS.
			THE Smethwick election and the return to Parliament of Mr Mosley. who combines with his Socialistic views great personal possessions. have produced in certain organs of the Press a violent little epidemic of self-con- conscious virtue. The Times. whose readers have been deeply stirred by the hyprocisy of the new member. chose the topic for its first leading article of 1927. ring- ing out the old and ringing in the new with a lengthy dissertation on the hypocrisy of man. with special refer- ence to John Bright and Mr Mosley. and assuming. in particular. that a member of the Labour Party who receives dividends or interest must be either fool or knave. The Economist is not a Socialist paper. but this assumption of the Times and other Unionist organs that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter honestly into the Labour Party has so many dangerous implications and consequences that a little cold logic might be applied to it with some advantage. The argument starts from the premise that the world can be sharply divided into two classes- those who believe that the Socialist ideal is impracticable. and the Socialists who think that the present system is unfair. and that a greater general prosperity could be achieved by their methods. The argument of the Times in re Mosley and Ponsonby is that those who hold this second opinion. who think that socialism is better than individualism. have no right to enjoy the advantages of private enter- prise and reap in dividends where others have sown in toil. Only the muddle-headed or the flagrantly dis- honest can enjoy the benefits of a system which he believes to be less fair and less efficient than his own rival scheme. Let us follow out a few of the logical consequences that flow from this argument. and see where we shall be landed if every member of the Labour Party with any claim to honesty of purpose must cut himself adrift from all the desirable things which spring from private enter- prise and profit. Let us take the case of the head of a great company or firm. who is a supporter of the Labour Party. such a man as the chairman of Carreras. who has made an amazing success for himself and his shareholders out of private enterprise. but is reputed to belong in politics to Labour. If it is wrong of a man in this position to hold Socialistic views and still manage a business on individualistic lines. enjoying the power and the income that his chairman- ship brings him-if this is wrong. what shall he do to be saved Shall he sell his interest in the business to some other man If he took that course he would simply be perpetuating the system that he believes to be evil and allowing the fell work to be carried on to the damnation of someone other than himself. Shall he hand the business over to the State for the State to manage The State will not accept it. and could not. under present conditions. run the business if it would. What is left to him Nothing but to disband the whole enterprise and leave his workpeople short of a job until that distant day when they may find work in an enterprise Socialistically managed by the State. On the Times line of argument no other course is open to an honest man. And if we are to appeal to consistency and nothing but consistency. why not carry the matter still further When. for example. the income-tax was reduced from 4s 6d to 4s in the x03030 00 many people believed that the reduc- tion was a mistake. and that the fair thing to do was to reduce not income-tax. but the indirect taxes which are paid by the poor consumer. Those who took this view should. on the Times argument. have insisted on paying their income-tax at 4s 6d. while their neighbours and competitors paid at 4s. The manufacturer. too. who believes that free imports are unfair has. on the Times argument. no right to buy for his works goods which are imported duty free. but should leave the advantage of these cheap purchases to his competitors. buying for his
			own factory at whatever increase of cost only such articles as are made in Great Britain. The man who believes that the competition of municipal enterprise is unfair to private companies must never travel in an L.C.C. tramcar the newspaper which believes that State industry ought not to be encouraged at the expense of private industry must never accept a message by the-Government cable to the detriment of the Eastern Telegraph Company.........and s on ad infinitum. At every point a logical development of the Times argument leads to absurdity. for we all know that whatever our ideals may be. we have to live in accordance with the system on which the world is managed to-day. not the system on which we think it might be better managed. on which we hope it will be managed a hundred years hence. If this were merely a matter of casuistry and chop- logic. merely a question whether Mr Mosley's and Mr Ponsonby's and the Times consciences ought to allow them to sleep at nights. it would not be worth pursuing. But it is something more. Underlying the argument of the Times and of all those who think with it is the assumption that politics have become a class war. a straight fight between the rich and the poor. in which every man must choose his side according to the amount of his possessions. Once you have declared that no rich man can with decency join the Labour party you invite the natural corollary from the other side that no poor man can with decency belong to any other party. a slogan with which the Red wing of Labour must surely be delighted. If we want a class war if we want political divisions to follow exactly the divisions of wealth- if we want politics brought into every business question and business to determine every political issue- if we want the well-to-do to vote one way because they are well-to-do. and the poor to vote the other way because they are poor. then by all means let us gibbet every rich man who declares himself a Socialist. and make him understand that he is either a fool or a knave. and. whether from folly or knavery. indubitably a traitor. Along those lines noany people. both in the Unionist party and in the Labour party. are thinking to-day. and the prevalence of this kind of political philosophy is perhaps the gravest feature of our national life. The Prime Minister's endeavour to check it in his own and in other parties is his greatest contribution to the welfare of the country. and it will be a national catastrophe if the party behind him refuse his lead and force us all. according to our credit at the bank. to enlist politically either in the army of the haves or the much more numerous army of the have-nots.

			AMERICAN INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN BONDS.
			THOSE of our readers who have followed the articles which have appeared in the last three numbers of the Economist on shareholdings in British companies will be interested in an examination of a similar kind in the United States contained in an article in the current number of Foreign Affairs.o Mr Dwight Morrow. well known as one of the partners of Messrs J. P. Morgan and Co.. being very much impressed by the fact that the list of foreign bond quotations quoted in the Chicago Tribune has risen in ten years from six items to 128. made a sample investiga- tion through the medium of 24 investment houses scattered all over the United States associated with his firm. in the hope of getting an answer to three questions- namely. who buys these bonds. why do they buy them. and what do they get when they have bought them The inquiry which was carried out in the autumn of 1924 and the spring of 1926 relates to five bonds com- paratively recently issued by the firm of Morgan. The results are summarised in the following table. which shows the proportion of each issue sold by the 24 houses. the number and amount of the total sales made by the 24 houses with the average value per sale. and a more detailed analysis dividing the sales into those investors who invested from 100 to 5.000 dollars. those who Foreign Affairs.o January. 1927.

			The figures show that the average amount of each sale varied from 2.944 dollars in the case of the Austrian sevens to 4.335 dollars in the case of the Argentine sixes. It further shows that from 8o to 90 per cent. of the number of sales in the case of each issue were made to investors whose purchases were limited to 5.000 dollars or less. while only 3 to 5 per cent. invested over 10.000 dollars. Moreover. the small investors took a very large section of each of the loans. the amount of the issue purchased by buyers who took 5.000 dollars or less vary- ing from 42.7 per cent. in the case of the Argentine sixes to nearly 63 per cent. in the case of the Austrian loan. Mr Morrow believes that the person who-invests in foreign bonds is probably the same person who invests in domestic bonds. -The purchasers are people all over the United States who are investing their savings. If the invest- ment in these bonds is helping American foreign trade. it is this saver of money who should be thanked. If the investment in these bonds is helping the restoration of the rest of the world to a normal condition. it is this saver of money who is entitled to the credit.o When Mr Morrow proceeds to his second and third questions he is in a region where precise answers are not possible. Investment in these foreign issues in America is based. like all investment. on two considerations- viz.. the safety of the principal and the size of the interest yield. The investor wants to be certain that he will con- tinue to receive an income on his bonds. he wants that income to be as large as possible. and. above all. he wants the principal returned to him on maturity. It cannot be asserted. however. that sentiment plays no part in our investments. It does. Many men in this country bought German bonds. after the successful launching of the Dawes Plan. not only because the interest rate was attractive and the principal seemed secure. but because they felt that they were thus asso- I ciating themselves in a fine venture to help Europe back on her I. feet. But after all proper weight is given to such considerations I as these. the question of safety of principal and of interest. and the attractiveness of the rate of interest. remain the considerations uppermost in the mind of a man who has done without the present use of his own money and is investing that money in order to protect the future of himself and of his family. Coming to closer grips with these points. Mr Morrow considers that if an investor in the Middle West were asked why he buys a bond of the Government of Austria or Japan. he would put in the forefront of his reasons that he has confidence in the bank which offers him the investment. This clearly throws a heavy responsibility on the banker. who. after all. because he is human. can- not be immune from making mistakes. But while the banker may make mistakes. he must never make the mistake of offering investments to his clients which he does not believe to be good. Moreover. when a banker directs savings into an investment he should believe that the borrowed money is to be put to a constructive use. To the cynic that may sound somewhat idealistic. It is. however. just plain common sense. No banker who wants to stay in business throughout the years
			wants to lend money to people who are not going to use it for a constructive purpose. The use to which the money is put is a very important factor in determining the ability of the borrower to pay his interest promptly and to return. at maturity. the principal. Finally. Mr Morrow comes to his third question. to which he can only give the answer that the investor in return for his money gets a promise. That promise may be the promise of a group of people associated together oil the other side of the earth. Moreover. so far as the promise relates to the payment of the principal of the bond. the promise does not mature in time to be kept by the particular members of the group who originally made it. It is a promise designed to be kept by the children of men now living. Yet somehow or other the banker who offers. that bond and the investor who buys that bond rely upon the people of Japan taxing themselves a generation from now in order to pay back the principal of that loan to the children of the person who invests in the bonds to-day. At first blush it is. a startling idea. It is particularly startling at this time. when so many people are saying that the various nations of the earth have lost faith in each other. Here we have printed in a Middle Western newspaper the record of the day's dealings in 12S foieign bond issues. Individuals in America are taking their own money. with its present command over goods and services. and surrendering that command to nations on the other side of the earth. and they receive in exchange for it a promise. The question may be asked nothing more than a promise To which answer may be made nothing less than a promise.......... The civilised world to-day is run on the basis of a belief in pro- mises. Whatever our doubts about the meaning of modern civi- lisation. we may at least take some comfort in the trust which men show in each other's promises Mr Morrow goes on to discuss the belief sometimes held that loans to foreign Governments made by American citizens throw upon the American Government the respon- sibility of using the armed forces of America for the purpose of collecting the debt. He quotes Mr Root. then Secretary of State. as saying in 1906 that -The United States has never deemed it to be suitable that she should use her army and navy for the collection of ordinary contract debts of foreign governments to her citizens.o But the dicta of statesmen. however eminent. cannot create international law. and the customs of nations must be sought rather in acts than in opinions. On this Mr Morrow observes that I-have not been able to find a clear case of a nation going to war for bondholders. It is only fair to say. however. that contract claims against a foreign government have often been joined with claims for other injuries. or with larger questions of political policy. and that so joined they have been made the basis of armed intervention. I have immediately in mind the military operations against Mexico in 1861. against Egypt in 1880. and against Venezuela in 1902.o Mr Morrow then proceeds to explain that at the Hague Peace Conference of 1907 the delegates evidently sought to put some limitation on the use of armed forces in this connection. which had not previously been accepted by all nations. Mr Morrow is. however. writ- ing from the point of view of the investor. who. in his opinion. is interested in seeing the policy of Mr Root scrupulously observed. Investors who buy foreign loans are in a position to appreciate what a fruitless remedy for breach of contract war is. The establishment of the principle that nations are justified in going to war where the sole issue is the collection of a debt would be not only most hurtful to the nation at large. but. in the long run. would prove injurious to the property interests of the bankers who sell and the investors who buy foreign government loans. Is there any-one who thinks that if a man owes him money and cannot pay it there is profit in going out and kill- ing the debtor Entiiely apart from the immorality of putting human lives to the hazard of modern war where the sole issues is a pecuniary claim. there is a conclusive practical reason against such a course in that war in the great majority of cases does not. and cannot. accomplish the desired result. The intelligent investor recognises that in the long rurr a defaulting Government hurts itself even more than it hurts its creditors. Even where specific taxes are allo- cated to the service of the loan. the main reliance of the creditor must be on the desire of the Government to maintain these revenues. Even when a foreign expert is put in control. the arrangement is of value only when made with the concurrence of the debtor Government in the belief that the arrangement will prove to its own advantage. Some domestic bonds turn out to be good and some worthless the same will be true of foreign bonds.
			Those nations who are borrowing in America because they actually need the money for a constructive purpose who have a solidarity of national feeling and a sense of the meaning and the value of national credit who are not incurring obligations beyond what may fairly be considered their capacity to handle-all those nations may be expected to pay their debts. As in the case of foreign. so in the case of domestic loans. it is upon good faith that the lender mainly relies. At home. it is true. a breach of contract may be proved and the law set in motion. -but we do not in practice put much reliance in the force of a sheriff to collect our debts.........when we need the sheriff to collect the debt we realise that our venture has turned out a failure......... there is no international sheriff. But there still remains our reliance upon good faith..........The credit of Govern- ments is not easily built up. It may easily be shattered. .........If good faith cannot be relied upon. it is better that the loan be not made. The words with which Hugo Grotius closed his great book more than 300 years ago are true- Not only is each commonwealth kept together by good faith. but that greater society of which nations are the members. If faith be taken away. the intercourse of men is abolished. Our readers will appreciate the importance of these observations in view of the high authority from which they came. The people of Nicaragua and Mexico would like to feel sure that they are endorsed at the White House.

			EDUCATION AND LIVELIHOOD.
			THE Stationery Office has issued within the last month two Reports dealing-though from different angles-with closely related questions- the first part of the Report of the Committee on Education and Industry (the Malcolm Committee). and a Report from the Consultative Com- mittee of the Board of Education on The Education of the Adolescent.o The two Reports may well be con- sidered together. The Malcolm Committee has addressed itself to the second part of its terms of reference- -the adequacy of the arrangements for enabling young persons to enter into and retain suitable employment.o Its report is largely concerned. therefore. with criticism of existing administrative machinery. And its conclusions. inevit- ably. have not the same interest for those concerned in education as will attach to its next Report. when it will advise upon the public system of education in England and Wales in relation to the requirements of trade and industry.o It will then be dealing. but from the point of view of results rather than of aims. with many of the questions already envisaged in the Report of the Con- sultative Committee. The problem of facilitating entry into employment is a complicated one. The State has made itself responsible. in various ways. for the young wage-earners and clearly that responsibility should be made continuous. But there is a gap of two years between the age of 14. when the child leaves school. and the age of 16. when he becomes insurable. that has not been effectively closed. Now these two years are of critical importance. It is essential that the best guidance possible should be given to the child at the beginning of his career. Whose business is it to ensure that such guidance is forthcoming The present position-somewhat haltingly arrived at- is that a dual authority is in being. Education authorities may. if they desire. exercise statutory powers if they do not do so. these must be taken up by the Ministry of Labour. The system has led to difficulties. The recom- mendation which the Committee makes is that the Ministry should now assume complete responsibility. To this recommendation there is an important addition-that consideration should be given to the setting up of a National Advisory Council. The suggestion should meet with widespread assent. It ought clearly to be the func- tion of some responsible body to envisage. as a whole. the problem of juvenile employment. Turning next to the important Report of the Consulta- tive Committee. the problem dealt with is that of the character and organisation of whole-time education up to -The Reports may be obtained from H.M. Stationery Office. Adastral House. Kingsway. W.C. 2. for is 6d and 2s respectively.
			the age of 15. The Committee was specifically asked to take into account. on the one hand. varying tastes and abilities.o and. on the other hand. -the probable occu- pations of the pupils in commerce. industry. and agricul- ture.o In other words. the terms of reference come very near to stating what has been regarded for many years as our central educational problem. The explanation of that problem must be sought in our educational history. Our educational system is not a coherent wholc. it has grown up. like the rest of our institutions. as best it could. The relations which obtain as between our elementary schools and the various types of grant-aided secondary school have never been clearly thought out. Each has preserved. as a thing apart. its. special aims and traditions. Hence the root difficulty is that it has not been easy to adapt to changing circumstances an elementary school system designed originally as an end in itself and it has long been obvious that sooner or later we should have to face this fact. Much progress has been made. it is true. during the last 25 years. The flow of pupils from the elementary into the secondary schools has been more than doubled. and there. have been fruitful experiments in the provision (on a modest scale) of new types of -post- primary-o education. But these developments have not touched the heart of the problem- fundamental defects remain. To begin with. attendance at school is compulsory up to the age of 14. But much of the education provided is inadequate to the pupils needs. The-o break -between childhood and adolescence occurs at the age of i or thereabouts. and it is at that age that the-o -primary-o stage of education should terminate. It is essential that the special and urgent needs of the critical years of adolescence should everywhere be served. Next. the scale on which further education is available is still insufficient. Admission from elementary schools to secondary schools is normally organised on a com- petitive basis. The existence of this competition is vicious in itself. The ideal ought not to be discrimination as between those more likely and less likely to profit-though discrimination is obviously better than nothing-but the provision for every child of the type of post-primary education which will give him the best chance in life. This is the true meaning of the much-abused slogan. -Secondary Education for All.o Finally. the present secondary school system is too restricted in its scope. It was designed to serve the needs of the Universities and the learned professions- and it is still to their requirements that it chiefly looks. A conse- quence of the restricted opportunities which it affords is that bias towards-o black-coated -occupations on the part of the better educated. which is both socially undesirable and economically harmful. A secondary education adapted to the needs of the craftsman. the mechanic. the farm labourer. and the shop assistant will not only make for a better-balanced and happier community. but will prove in the long run a paying proposition. These are the considerations which the Committee has had in.-mind in drafting its Report. They duly set forth the appropriate remedies for the defects which have been summarised. As to these. there is nothing sensational. But the authority with which the Committee speaks and the unanimity of its conclusions justify the description of the Report as an epoch-making document. The Committee's main proposals are twofold-o -that post-primary -education should be made available for all normal children. and that after the lapse of five years (i.e.. as from 1932 onwards) the school-leaving age should be compulsorily raised from 14 to 15. The latter proposal needs legislation- the former. though its attainment with- out is conceivable. will probably in the end require legis- lation also. The general scheme which the Committee has in view is the provision of post-primary education in four principal ways-o -(1) in secondary schools of the existing type- 2 in schools providing a four years course of a -realistic-o or practical kind 3 in similar. but less highly organised. schools 4 (where local conditions are difficult) in senior or central classes. The child is to be transferred. normally at the age of 11. to the type of school which fits him best. The aim.-in every case is to enable him to make the most of his latent powers and to
			bring him into contact with-o the larger interests of 1 mankind.o I The difficulties to be surmounted are obviously con- c siderable. Educational advance is costly. and the Chan- I cellor of the Exchequer is not in a generous mood. t Administrative organisation will be diliicult- we have not t yet heard the last of the non-provided schools. And the t raising of the school age will result in a demand for i maintenance allowances to add to the cost of the scheme. I But these difficulties must be faced. and ought to be I faced now. For delay may prove in the long run a ruinous extravagance. We cannot compete in world i markets against such countries as America and Germany 1 unless our educational system is planned not less carefully i than theirs. And it is of vital importance to remember that educa- 1 tional advance takes time. New and better schools have to be built and equipped- teachers have to be trained- the relations of contending authorities have to be adjusted. It is to be hoped. therefore. that the Board of Education (despite the caveat of Sir Aubrey Symonds) will proceed without delay to the consideration of the ways and means of implementing the Report. What. finally. of the larger question which. on a perusal of the two Reports. begins dimly to emerge-the antithesis between-o education for life-o and-o educa- tion for livelihood-o -the idea. on the one hand. that the purpose of education is to open up for the individual possibilities of knowledge and of culture which will place him a little farther from the savage and a little nearer to the immortals and. on the other. that its object is to train such faculties as he has in such a way as to give him the best chance of earning a living Can the two be reconciled The Consultative Committee seems to think so. And it is to be hoped that its proposals will not appear to the Malcolm Committee incompatible with industrial requirements. For in their suggestion of a National Council for Juvenile Employment appears a dim adumbration of what may well prove a promising line of advance. Employers of labour must be brought into touch. more closely than they are at present. with the educational machine and must be invited to co-operate in making it an effective instrument of social and economic progress. This it cannot be until the wage-earner is satisfied that he has been given the fullest opportunity of developing his own powers.

			SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS THE NEW SITUATION. I
			(BY A CAPE TOWN correspondent.) THE complete and perfectly sincere acceptance by General Hertzog of the definition laid down by the Imperial Con- ference of the status of the Dominions. accompanied. as it has been. by an equally explicit acceptance on the part of his chief lieutenant. Mr Tielman Roos. may possibly have puzzled English readers. In the same way they were a little puzzled by the genuinely cordial reception of the Prince of Wales last year by the Hertzog Govern- ment. On that occasion I was able to point out that the key to the puzzle lay within the intricacies of South African party politics. The same is even more true in the present case. Though there is still some amount of feeling in Scuth Africa that can only be described as anti- British. it would be a profound mistake to assume that hatred of England and a burning desire to throw off all allegiance to the British Crown have been the main in- spiring motives of the Nationalist Party. Nationalists of the Hertzog type have been ready to admit. especially in recent years. that their ideals might be attainable without secession from the Empire. On the other hand. there have been many. especially in the Transvaal and the Free State. who genuinely de- sired separation and a return to the conditions of the old Republics. though they do not appear to have devoted muoh thought to the bearing of such a policy upon the continuance of the Union itself. Such separation they took to be the real purpose of the Nationalist Party. and their support was given to it for that reason. Leaders like Mr Tielman Roos. whatever their real feelings may I
			have been. made full use of this section for electoral pur- poses and frequently spoke of secession in a perfectly definite sense. Moreover. the attempt made at the Bloemfontein Hereniging Conference in 1920 to re-unite the Smuts and the Hertzog followings broke down oil this very point. General Smuts then turned to incor- porate the Unionists. the party termed-o Jingo by the Nationalists on account of its steady support of the Im- perial connection. It was with this new party that General Smuts won the election of 1921. where Secession was the single issue. How far. then. have the National- ists changed their view since 1920 Their cue to-day is to maintain that they have not changed it at all. but have gained their end. But many of their leaders have spoken so definitely of Secession in the absolute sense that it is possible to make out quite a strong case for the conten- tion that they have been converted. Much of the con- fusion on the point is due to the exigencies of the party game as it is played in South Africa. In no country do party politics turn so much upon the personal opinions and attitudes of leaders. and in no country do leaders show such finished skill in the arts of ambiguity and equivocation. The Boer. as a fighter. never liked th frontal attack. and he always kept open alternative lines of retreat whenever he could. So. too. in politics. -Secession -might mean the whole hog in the baclc- veld- in the towns it could be expounded to mean that the hog. though untethered. would still remain in the farmyard. But even after all allowance has been made for the curious twists of politics and for the slim tergiversations of politicians. the confusion and cross-purposes of recent years remain unexplained. and the suddenness of Generai Hertzog's-o conversion remains miraculous unless we allow also for a good deal of genuine misunderstanding. In a former article I pointed out that the English word independence-o is generally used without discrimina- tion to render either of two Dutch words which are per- fectly distinct in meaning. Onafhanlzelilzlaeid is not quite the same thing as selfstandinlacid. The one has refer- ence to an external non-dependence- the other to internal autonomy. The one is negative in its emphasis- them other positive. It is. perhaps. only fair to General Hertzog and the bulk of his followers to assume that the second rather than the first of these more truly ex- pressed the goal of their efforts. They were-o -ant .- British-o only in so far as Britain typified for them out- side influences interfering with the free decision of South African issues on South South African soil. Who shaM say that such an attitude is not intelligible in a country with such a history The real matter at issue was no mere crotchet of a disgruntled perversity. It was rather the very solid question whether. as a matter of fact. South Africa was a free State in the full sense of the world. Add to this the strong dash of legalism which marks the Afrikander politician. his unwillingness to adopt the British habit of caring little for forms and paper formulao. so long as the solid practice suits him. and you have the main elements of the situation. Under such conditions it was natural that the other side should pin Nationalists down to the Secession issue. and the unguarded language of many Nationalists. coupled with the real separation of many sons of the backveld. gave General Smuts and his party sufficient material for their purpose. Such was the situation when the Nationalists came into power in 1924. It seems probable that even before he became Prime Minister General Hertzog had realised that he must relieve his policy of the Secession incubus if he were ever to secure for him- self that measure of English and moderate Dutch support without which no South African Government can continue for long. In April. 1925. from his place in Parliament. he repudiated in the most explicit terms any idea of Secession as a practical policy. His words are sufficiently remarkable. and should be recalled at such a time as this. Such secession. as far as the Union is concerned. would be a flagrant mistake and a national disaster. should it be brought about under circumstances causing either the English or the Dutch section as a whole to feel that the change thus brought about had been caused by the imposition of the will-of the one section upon the other.o And he concluded a very definite statement by
			declaring. I have not the slightest intention of recom- mending secession say this here again this after- noon. that I am in favour of the British connection being maintained. It is significant that throughout this statement the Prime Minister laid special emphasis upon what South Africa calls -top-dog -policy. The real sting of the Secession insect. according to him. lay in the feeling of a large section of the people that its freedom was cur- tailed by the -dominance of another section. acting with strong support from outside. Whatever truth there may be in a belief that such dominance was practised. the conviction that such was the case goes far to explain the Nationalists position. At Zastron O.F.S. later in the year. General Hertzog repeated his statement. and on this occasion made much of a distinction between admission of the right to secede. and the actual adoption of Secession as a policy. The difference from the Nationalist point of view was im- portant- incidentally. it also illustrates the legalistic spirit which has been such a marked feature of the whole lengthy controversy. But to reassure his English fellow-citizens was not all that the Prime Minister had to do. He had also to con- vince his own followers that he was securing for them what they wanted. That is. he had to keep his own party together. while at the same time he had to calm the apprehensions of those who were merely taking certain Nationalist leaders at their word. In the circumstances. .as described above. this was no easy feat. The signifi- cance of the Imperial Conference from the South African point of view is that he has brought it off not only with signal success. but with added kudos to himself and his party. While the Opposition exclaims. -We told you so all along.o the other side jubilantly declares that it has achieved its aim. and hails General Hertzog as his country's hero. One perfervid Minister even declares that his chief has reformed the British Empire.o In any case. the Hertzog star is in the ascendant. for he has shown real statesmanship in his patient and dexterous handling of an extraordinarilv difficult problem. The situa- tion now is a little like that when Disraeli dished the Whigs by stating their policy of extension of the franchise. To have delighted his own followers to the point of exuberance. and to have reduced his opponents to the week resource of shouting. We thought of it first- is from the party point of view. no mean achievement for General Hertzog. His Chief of Staff. Mr Tielman Roos. who has been generally looked upon as the leader of out-and-out Seces- sionism. was no less prompt and explicit in his acceptance of the new situation. Speaking on the East Rand a day or two after the publication of the report of the Con- ference. he declared - -On behalf of the Nationalist Party of the Transvaal. whether we have obtained more or less. I wish to say that we are completely satisfied. We are satisfied with the position and we are satisfied that there is no longer a constitutional question in South Africa. and upon that basis we will now be able to work for the economic development of South Africa.........There is no question of secession in South Africa- no question of Republicanism- no constitutional question ol an kind like those raised in the past. -We fully accept what was freely given us by the British Government. and the British Government. by giv- ing us this. has made the position of the British Empire much stronger. The relations now existing between South Africa and the British Empire are permanent rela- tions. and we will make our work better in the interests of civilisation all over the world.o A statement like this. made with-pointed deliberation by such a man. is of the first importance. Its effect in South Africa was even more marked than that of the report of the Conference itself. and served to dispel all doubts of what to many seemed too good to be true. One point of attack remains. What about that now famous Article .Four of the Nationalist Party Constitu- tion which sets the attainment of -sovereign indepen- dence as the goal of the party General Smuts claims. with some pertinence. that if the object has been attained. why keep the clause If it has not. why all the jubila-
			tion- The Nationalists admit the changed situaf-on. but promise only to -edit -the Article. since independence. once won. has still to be maintained. But. in view of the boat-burning declarations of the Prime Minister and Mr Roos. the matter does not appear to have quite the im- portance that some newspapers seem to attach to it. There is not likely to be sinew enough in Article Four now to resist the reconstruction of parties that must become inevitable. Indeed. the signs of it are already becoming apparent. though the new lines are not yet discernible. Some personalities who have played impor- tant parts in South African life may be jettisoned in this shifting of political cargo. an'd some who lack the mental agvility to adjust themselves readily to the new situation will be left stranded (or even marooned One thing is certain- Colour. and the tremendous issues arising from it. will now be the predominant factor in determining the lines of party cleavage. But that opens up too vast a field to be entered upon here. From the point of view of the immediate facts. the interest of these decisive days lies in the fact that the Nationalists. in securing a satisfactory definition of sovereign independence.o have unwittingly contributed to a new conception of sovereignty itself. For what would the Austinians of last century have thought of a -sovereign independence.o the very condition of which was the acceptance of a definite partnership with other sovereign independents.o equal and pledged What could they make of such -metaphysics-o

			OUR INDEX NUMBERoox20140A YEAR'S PRICES.
			THE general movement in prices last month was small. but. owing partly to the fact that quotations are now once again obtainable for British coal. and that these are verv much lower than those of the imported variety which were used in compiling the figures during the later part of the coal stoppage. and partly to a fall in pig-iron. our Index Number shows a substantial drop during December. the total falling by 210 points to 3975. which is the lowest figure recorded since January. 1916. This fall is really due to the drop in cotton and other textiles which occurred a few months ago. but it was obscured by the rise in coal prices. This is brought out more clearly by an examination of the year's movements. During 1926 the total index number fell by 276 points. of which the textiles group accounted for 261. From the table below it will be seen that the highest level last year was reached in September. the difference between this and the figure-for December being 271.

			During December all cereals and meat. with the excep- tion of pork. were slightly lower. tea declined. and sugar rose further. Textiles moved very little. but there was a sharp drop in pig-iron prices. as well as in coal. A
			further small decline in rubber was the only change of importance in the miscellaneous section. In a year. however. in which some very exceptional movements took place in several commodities. the situa- tion can best be set out by giving- detailed quotations for the chief commodities which enter into the index number.

			Wheat closes the year substantially below the level of the last two Decembers. but not so low as at the end of 1923. At the end of last year. and again in the early summer. there was a hardening tendency. and yet again one more flutter in October. when a bad report of the Canadian situation frightened the market. But the present outlook. which is fully discussed in another article in this issue. is in favour of easier prices. Potatoes show their usual seasonal movement. while beef prices have continued the downward drift of the last two or three years. Tea has been a dear commodity for three or four years past. a big upward swing having set in during 1922. In mid-1924 a further upward move from about IS 3d took place. which persisted until the summer of this year but. as the table shows. there is now a distinct weakening. In these main groups prices are lower than a year ago. On the other hand. sugar ends the year at a much higher figure than last year. a change having set in during the autumns At the moment the estimates of the world's crop show a de- cline of over a million tons. The situation is dealt with elsewhere in this issue. Coffee is also up in price. All the textiles shown in the table show a considerable fall. the largest proportionate reduction being in the case of jute. which rose to an exceptionally high figure in 1925 in anticipation of a small crop. Much the most important price change. however. is in American cotton. which is now below the pre-war level. As our table shows. the fall occurred in the third quarter of the year on the publication of record crop estimates. Quotations have since been steady. Egyptian cotton has shown a smaller fall. and these reductions in the cost of raw material are naturally reflected in the price of cotton yarn and cloth. the price of cotton yarn being quoted at 25 per cent. below the figure of last December. Wool prices fell in the summer. but have since somewhat hardened. while the silk quota- tions show the effect over a period of the year of the com- petition of artificial silk. In the next table we show similar figures for metals and miscellaneous products-o

			The figure for coal calls for no comment except to point out that at the end of the year prices were at about-the same level as at the end of 1923 and 1924. and were somewhat higher than at the end of 1925. when the sub- sidy was in operation. The figure is still 90 per cent. above the average quoted in our index number table for i9r3. Pig-iron and steel quotations were naturally affected by the coal stoppage. but did not fully reflect the famine in coal. These quotations were largely affected by foreign prices. and refer to a very small turnover. Lead has been low this year. but tin. after a very sub- stantial fall during the summer. ends the year at a higher figure than in previous years. though a little below the top figure of the year. Copper has been a sagging marlcet. while rubber also ends the year at a low level.

			Last month's decline reduces the increase over the July. 1914. level to 55 per cent. in the total. while textiles are only 39 per cent. higher than at the outbreak of war. Subsidiary foodstuffs. on the other hand. thanks to the rise in sugar. are log per cent. above the pre-war level.

			THE WHEAT POSITION AND OUTLOOK.
			(by A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) IT is pertinent. in the middle of the wheat crop year. briefly to review the last five months of 1926 and to survey the outlook for the first five months of 1927. This season the world wheat markets have witnessed no such sti-iking- developments as took place in the last half ot 1924 or of 1925. From May. 1924. to January. 1925. there was a transition from a year of extreme ease to a period of extreme tightness in the international position. The rise of prices culminated. under the influence of extra- ordinary speculation. late in January. 1925. at a level 70
			to ioo per cent. above that of the preceding May. In August-October. 1925. prices declined heavily. but advanced rapidly in October-December. By comparison. the world wheat markets have been relatively quiet in the last half of 1926. In European importing countries as a whole stocks of import wheat were low. wheat crops were only moderately good. and harvest operations and marketings were somewhat delayed. India and North African exporting countries. which harvest early. had mediocre crops. Little good wheat was left in Argentina on August ist. and very little of any kind in Australia. But the large crop of American winter wheat came forward promptly to supply importers demands and it was supplemented by good shipments of Canadian wheat and larger exports than usual from Russia and the Lower Danube basin. The rise in ocean freights. occasioned by the British coal strike. was the major disturbing factor in the situation. Especially important was the striking advance in September-October. when rates on leading routes rose by 5s per quarter. in consequence of sudden pressure for chartering vessels to carry coal from the United States to Great Britain. The result stimulated the more rapid marketing of domestic crops in Europe. increased import purchases from European exporters (especially for rail shipment). and restrained import purchases in North America and Argentina. At the same time crop news from Canada. Australia. and Argentina promised an easier market later. After mid-November ocean freights declined sharply. and an easier international position became assured by the presence of large visible supplies in Canada and the confirmation of good early harvests in Australia and Argentina. The world wheat crop appears slightly larger than last year's and the largest ever harvested with the exception of the bumper crops of 1913 and 1915. Like the crop of 1925. it will approach 500 million quarters. The large world wheat crop of 1925 was so distributed that the international market position was nearly as tight in 1925-26 as in 1924-25. when the crop was much smaller. The 1925 crops were unusually large in Europe. but though European importing countries required less foreign wheat and European exporting countries had more to sell. surpluses in overseas exporting countries were so small (as the result of poor crops in India. the United States. and the Southern Hemisphere) that prices were fairly high. The crop of 1926 is differently distributed. Soviet Russia and other European exporting countries have about as large crops as in 1925. but in the rest of Europe as a whole the crop is only fair-above average in Spain and Italy. much below average in France. Less of Europe's. latest crop will be required to replenish stocks. and consumption will probably be reduced. Urgent import requirements will accordingly be increased by less than the decline in yield. While European crops (ex- Russia) are some 20 million quarters less than last year. Russia and the Lower Danube countries appear to have a larger export surplus than in 1925-26. and overseas exporting countries have around 25 million quarters more wheat than last year. as a result of larger crops in the United States. Australia. and Argentina. This implies a much larger margin between exporters surpluses and importers requirements-in other words. a distinctly easier international position-for 1926-27 than obtained in either of the two preceding years. Most of the special factors that tended to sustain prices in recent months are now weakened or eliminated. and further recessions in active import and export markets are in prospect as soon as Southern Hemisphere shipments get under way. The decline will be resisted by the willingness of exporting and importing countries to enlarge their wheat stocks. and perhaps in particular by the Canadian Pool. which may not sell freely unless or until large crops are forecast for 1927. Canada. Argentina. and Australia will furnish the great bulk of the exports during the next few months. Of Canada's large surplus less than half has left the sea- board. though probably more than half was officially recorded as exported before December 31st. After very light exports in August-November. 1926. heavy ship-
			ments from Australia and Argentina are now to be ex- pected. because of early harvests in both countries and the large Argentine carry-over of old wheat that can be exported mixed with grain from the new harvest charter conditions. however. may somewhat restrain the export movement. Russia and Danube exporters have already exported 40-50 million bushels since August ist. They-may be expected to continue to ship. though not at the pace characteristic of the autumn months and their total wheat exports promise to be larger than in any previous year since the war. Further exports from the United States will consist. not of the hard winter wheat which strongly predominated in the July-November exports. but chiefly of Pacific wheat. durum. and flour. Even if exports are heavy in the next few months. outward carry-overs are likely to be increased. Carry- lovers into 1926-27 were moderate to low. This year. with a second big world crop in succession. with an easier international position and somewhat lower prices. larger carry-overs are probable in several countries. The readiness to enlarge carry-overs may. in- deed. afford significant resistance to price-depressing tendencies and prevent radical declines unless (or until) large crops in 1927 should be assured. If spring prospects for 1927 crops should be poor. the tendency to increase carry-overs. especially in export countries. will be accentuated. Beyond the end of May. however. new crop developments will exert a powerful-perhaps a dominant-influence upon trade and prices. Except in India. where there is ground for hope of a larger harvest in 1927 than in 1925 or 1926. there is little reliable basis for forecasting the coming crops. At present one must regard predictions of the next crop as in the palm of prophecy and assume that 1927 wheat crops will be. in the aggregate. somewhat smaller than the good crops of 1925 and 1926. but not radically inferior.

			THE STOCK EXCHANGE IN 1926.
			Whatever the disappointments experienced by the Stock Exchange in 1926. its experiences. in view of all the industrial turmoil which marked the year. contrast very favourably with those of most other branches of the country's business life. Quotations. generally speaking. stood four square to all the winds of adversity. and a memorable feature of the year was the remarkable steadi- ness of markets during the general strike of the first ten days of May. when the danger of an investment panic was enhanced by the cessation of newspaper publication. Neither then. nor at any of the black moments during the long drawn-out coal stoppage. did any real lack of confi- dence or any exaggerated selling movement develop. In fact. a suivey of the whole field of public investment
			shows that for holders of securities 1926 was more favour- able than 1925. According to the calculations of the Bankers Vlagazine. 1926 saw a rise of nearly 79 millions in the aggregate market value of 365 representa- tive securities. as compared with a decline of about .54 millions in the preceding year. There has also. as our contemporary points out. been a change in the character of movements during the year. for in 1925 the fixed- dividend group showed a fall of .154 millions. and the variable-dividend group an expansion of 100 millions while in 1926 the aggregate appreciation of 79 millions. just mentioned. was divided as to 21 millions in the fixed-interest group and 58 millions in the variable- dividend list. For mid-December. 1925. the Bankers Magazine index number was for fixed interest securities 108.8 (December. 1921 ioo). This figure rose to i-io.8 in February. fell to 109.6 in March. but from April to October was remarkably steady between 1-1-0.0 and 1-1-0.2. a subsequent relapse taking it to 109.3 in December. The variable dividend index number from 132.5 in December. 1925. moved down to 128.7 in April. but then recovered to 136-5 in Septem- ber and ended the year at 135.7. It is surely remarkable that in a year of widespread industrial losses the net movements of variable-dividend securities should have been in favour of holders at all. The figures quoted above reveal the broad and general trend of the stock markets during 1926. and this we pro- pose to illustrate further by examining. with the help of some statistical tables. the year's movements in various groups and sections. We will begin our review with British and Indian Government stocks -

			This table shows that British Government securities did not in themselves make any great contribution to the aggregate rise in fixed-interest securities. But consider- ing that domestic events of the year might easily have shaken British credit. and also that the average of money rates was higher than in 1925. the comparative firmness of quotations is satisfactory although. of course. the coal stoppage cut both ways. and released for-o gilt- edged -investment money that would in the ordinary way have been employed in financing production and trade. British Government stocks appreciated in the last few days of the year. because the terms of the new issue of-4 per cent. Consols were held to be favourable to existing securities. The strength of Indian stocks is notable. and was due to realisation of the financial and economic im- provement in that great Empire. Dominion Government issues have tended to move rather mcre unfavourably for holders than British Government stocks. Our second table shows a selection of the former and of foreign Government issues -

			The fluctuations of French and Italian issues in sympathy I with the movements of the franc and the lira have been I
			somewhat wide. but the London quotations of the securities of both Governments end the year very much where they began. Chinese bonds naturally have suffered heavy depreciation in view of the chaotic conditions in that country. The best feature of the foreign market was the stiength and popularity of European reconstruc- tion loans. the list of which received important additions in the shape of the Belgian Stabilisation Loan. whose fine reception and big premium are shown by the figures in the above table. and of the Bulgarian Refugee issue made just before Christmas. Turning next to the railway sections. we find a decidedly satisfactory record -

			Considering the industrial troubles of the year and the very large fall in gross receipts caused by the loss of heavy freight traffic. it is remarkable that the ordinary stocks of the Home Railways have not a worse record to show. In the list of Dominion and foreign railway stocks quoted above there are only two blots on an excellent record. Unsatisfactory conditions in Cuba. caused by the sugar crisis. were responsible for the fall in United of Havana. while Antofagasta shared in the depreciation affecting all stocks dependent upon the fortunes of the nitrate industry of Chile. American rails rose substan- tially. prosperity in the United States having greatly im- proved their earning power. The improved position of Canadian railways is clearly reflected in the table. and Grand Trunk Pacific debentures gained substantially on the belated settlement. the terms of which have yet to be ratified by the Government at Ottawa. Argentine rails had a good year. and heavy crops over most of South America brought the stocks of railways in that quarter of the globe into demand. We pass on to British banking. insurance. and indus- trial securities (mainly at home). of which the next table gives a wide selection -

			This table illustrates the most remarkable of the Stock Exchange features of the year. In a list of industrial and commercial securities covering a wide area of the nation's economic field rises in quotations exceed declines in a year of almost unparalleled difficulties. Many. of course. including iron and steel shares. had been severely depressed by the approach of the stoppage which is now over. and by its passing leaves strong hopes of renewed activity. The tobacco group was the centre of great activity Brunner. Mond and Nobels fluctuated on the formation of the great chemical combine shipping shares benefited to some extent from the rise in freight rates brought about by the coal stoppage Dunlops. without being substantially changed on balance. have been a very active market. Rubber. oil. and nitrate shares are grouped in the next table-

			The rubber share market is the Stock Exchange dis- appointment of 1926. One of the hopes of the year at its opening was that the boom in this section. which had been in progress through the autumn. would be renewed. But this did not occur the price of the raw material sagged and share prices with it. The bulk of the fall took place in the early part of the year. and there was further weakening in the autumn. with a slight recovery towards the close of the year. Although there has been no boom in oil shares. and Shells and Mexican Eagles are slightly lower on the year and British Controlled issues slumped severely. the oil market as a whole was fairly steady. Nitrate shares fell sharply on the aggravation of the difficulties of the Chilean industry. We close with a small table. including a few prominent mining shares -

			The feature of the mining markets was a period of vivid excitement in tin shares during the autumn. based on a large rise in the price of the metal. Leading South African mines impraved. but copper shares are chiefly lower on the year. The upshot of this review. in a word. is that British holders of securities have a great deal to be thankful for in a year which might easily have brought disaster. They were not. however. quite so lucky as their American counterparts. The Federal Reserve Bulletin for December gives the following movements of security index numbers between November. 1925. and November. 1926 -That for 199 industrial stocks rose from 150.4 to 157.5 that for 31 railroad stocks rose from 120 to 132.4 and that for 40 bonds rose from 92.44 to 95.66. Nevertheless. Wall street suffered a temporary break in prices in the autumn. which for the time being was more disturbing to investors than any general movement of the year on the London markets.

			CHINA A BRITISH RESIDENT'S VIEW.
			A correspondent in Tientsin sends us the article which we print below. It states the point of view of British residents in the Treaty Ports. and as such we gladly give it publication. Our own views on the situation have been expressed in a series of articles. and we propose. further. to reply to our Tientsin correspondent next week. THE salient troubles from which China is at present suffer- ing and the manifold difficulties facing the foreigner in his attempts to discover a remedy and to achieve the desired friendly relationship with the Chinese are sufficiently well known. But it must be borne in mind that these troubles are largely symptoms of a disease which requires much deeper diagnosis. (In a book recently published.. VVhat's Wrong with China.o by Rodney Gilbert. an attempt has been made at such diagnosis. and to those sufliciently interested this book is strongly recommended.) The basic fact is that we are dealing with a people of an entirely different mentality from our own. To attempt. therefore. to deal with them by methods prompted by our own mentality is likely to be unsuc- cessful. For instance. a policy of patient conciliation can only be successful if the recipient understands the underlying motive. and consequently eventually recipro- cates. A policy of helpfulness can only be understood- by a people who think that they require help. A policy of frank and open dealing pre-supposes. to be successful.. that honesty is appraised at its true moral value. And so one could go on almost ad Infinitum. In deal- ing with the Chinese it should be borne in mind-o -(1) That China has never known. in the three thousand years or so of her existence as a nation. any rule except the rule of force. This rule of force has at times been. tempered with justice- at times it has been cruelly despotic. But in either case the fact remains that no x0303 iveak rule. however kindly. has ever prospered. The Chinese under discipline are a very worthy people. They are inherently amenable to discipline. and are entirely at sea when discipline is removed. as it has been removed. as far as internal affairs are concerned. since the revolu- tion in i9i 1-and. as far as external affairs are concerned.. since the Great War. 2 That China's history has been a history of con- tinual invasion and conquest. In order to make up for her warlike shortcomings and to absorb the numerous peoples who have conquered her. she used her culture as her moral weapon. In this she has been extraordin- arily successful. but in order to achieve this success it was essential that her culture should be ritualised and made fixed and non-elastic. and that any attempt to go beyond this established ritual should be absolutely resisted. The result has been that for something like 2.000 years her mentality. her philosophy. her literature. her arts. and even her language have become and re- mained mummified.o China to-day is. on any Western standard of knowledge. hopelessly ignorant. She still refuses to realise as a fact that any world of consequence exists outside her own -Middle Kingdom.o or that anv civilisation. such as the Western. can possibly have-a claim to equality. let alone superiority. Owing also to- the-o caged -nature of her mental processes. she remains entirely unconscious that there is anything wrong with her. and is as exclusive and proud in her supposed superiority as she was two thousand years ago. This is practically true of the whole of China. and is not. I think. an exaggeration. Even the small handful of ad- vanced leaders -educated in the West or on Westerns lines have never succeeded in overcoming this inherent mental handicap. and no Western-educated Chinese has yet shown signs of realising the position of his country or made the slightest attempt to work for her salvatiorr on any hut the Chinese lines of selfishness and force. 3 That. in defence of and in course of this process of ritualisation of her culture. and to preserve the dignity to which she felt herself entitled. China developed the code of face.o This code is far-reaching. and is by far the most powerful influence affecting her conduct in all the affairs-of life. Practically speaking. nothing matters so long-as face can be saved. A lie is at all times. and on any occasion. entirely justified in the eyes of the Chinese. where the saving of face is involved. This
			is continually seen in the innumerable manifestoes which are issued and circulated. and in the high-sounding pro- clamations and circular telegrams sent out from Peking. which are not even meant to be believed. but are merely N elaborate face-saving devices. Honesty has never been practised in China for reasons of moral righteousness. but simply and solely for purposes of expediency. The moment expediency disappears. honesty disappears with it. This has been painfully evident of recent years .to foreign merchants. who have suffered from the piece goods crisis of 1921. and the northern cotton crisis of 1924. and is also illustrated by the fact that China honoured her foreign obligations so long as it was in her interest to do so. After the formation of the Consortium. and the embargo on foreign loans to China. the expediency disappeared. and China promptly defaulted on her unsecured obliga- tions. The Chinese. therefore. cannot be called a truth- ful and honest people. Truth and honesty. as we know them. are entirely subservient in China to the saving of face and the expediency of the moment. .-(4) That the process of ritualisation referred to above has permeated the whole Chinese outlook on life and mental attitude to a point where reasoned argument on Western-lines is both unavailing and a waste of time. It has stereotyped their written language and their speech. which remains formal. non-elastic. and unadapted for expansion. and. as a consequence. it has stereotyped their mode of thought. so that the logical process of thought called for by Western-progress is entirely beyond their powers. 5 That the Chinese are not in reality a patriotic people. The-o wave of national feeling.o about which so much has been said lately. is actually another of those waves of hostility to the foreigner which are born of the fact that. for the first time in her history. China has come into contact with a force that she cannot-o absorb -or understand. For thousands of years she was accustomed to physical conquest by surrounding tribes. Invariably she absorbed them by peacefully imbuing them with her own culture (which. as we have seen. became stereotyped in the process). The arrival of the foreigner. however. with his own culture. which he has steadfastly refused to exchange for hers. and with force behind him. has created an entirely new situation for the Chinese. who. puzzled and alarmed. have tried various methods of countering it. After the failure of the Boxer rebellion to counter it by force. attempts were made. and are still being made. to discover the secret of the foreigner's strength and to imitate his military methods. with the hope of eventually beating him at his own game. The innate conceit of the nation. which is sufficient in any case to prevent its I making the fullest use of foreign teaching. coupled with- I the physiological differences between the Western and the Oriental. are-sufficient to foredoom such efforts to failure. Latterly. however. China has discovered a new weapon in 1 the lack of unity among the foreign Powers. and she is using this new weapon most effectually. But all the time she is bewildered and uncertain. and sporadic outbursts I of so-called national feeling. not to be considered as I patriotism. are merely the outward symptoms of this I .bewilderment. The primitive Confucian system of philo- I .sophy. with its insistence on the family as the social unit. has become ritualised in China. The Chinese possess no 1 public spirit whatsoever outside their own immediate- family circle. Self-abnegation within the family circle is practised to a far greater extent than with us Westerners. I But it is accompanied by utter disregard of and callous- ness to neighbours outside this circle. While a Chinese wili share all he has with the members of his own family- (even irrespective of their individual behaviour towards 1 him). he will not raise a helping hand to one in distress outside the family. unless there are reasons which make it - expedient for him to do so. He shoots the rubbish from I his own gardens over the wall into his neighbour's. who continues the process. This entire lack of civic spirit is sufficiently shown to any observer in China by the state i of the roads. the lack of co-operative sanitation. 0c.. of 1 any Chinese town and even of large cities contiguous to- foreign concessions. where it might at least have been expected that the force of nearby foreign example would 1 have made itself felt. and is sufficient proof that the x22C5 Chinese are incapable of municipal or. indeed. any form 1
			r 1 of Government in which a civic or co-operative spirit is .-called for. 6 That bribery and corruption in the universally prac- tised form of squeeze still further accentuates this lack of patriotism and the futility of expecting any form of so-called democratic government or external control to succeed which is based on any sanction except that of force. It is probably not too much to say that there is not a single man out of the millions in China who does not practise-o squeeze.o Out of the higher positions in the State a very short period of office is sufficient to enable the holder to amass a huge fortune. At the other end of the scale a class. such as the beggar class (an inherited calling banded together. as usual in China. into-o trade unions). levies sufficient blackmail on those above to enable it to resist starvation. The enormous masses are ground down by the very few. and are left with the merest margin of existence. To take a single example. it has been stated. probably with truth. that the fairly large class of rickshaw-pullers in the towns have. on an average. throughout their lives 10 cents (or. say. two-. pence) between them and starvation. Continuous and degrading work is. therefore. the lot of the majority of the population from the earliest childhood to old age. and the reputation of the Chinese for industry has certainly been gained more by dire necessity than by volition. 7 That the Chinese are inherently incapable of under- standing or appreciating such a policy as that of patient conciliation.o To them it can only mean one of two things -Either it must signify an acknowledgment of her superior virtues and a confession of weakness. or else it must represent a bid for favour. A gift in China has invariably one of these two meanings- it is either a tribute from a servant to his master. from inferior to superior. expecting an equivalent return in favour or in kind. or an out-and-out bribe. That a gift could be prompted by disinterested generosity (even if such were actually the case) is inconceivable to the Chinese mind. In many other directions. too numerous to mention. Chinese mentality is diametrically opposed to the Western. The Chinese dislikes exercise and lacks the active virility of the Westerner. loves repose. and the -basking in vacuitv for hours on end. which would be mental torture to a Westerner. possesses none of their sense of sports- manship. has none of their ethical ideals. and has no material ambition. except for the amassing of wealth. or the staving off of starvation. A desire for study. explora- tion. 0c.. for their own sakes is incomprehensible to him. He dislikes straightforwardness. and is circuitous on argument and thought. While self-controlled under physiological influences. and under the inherent influence of -face.o he can be emotional. passionate. and excitable either in the interests of -face.o or when matters of face -are not involved. His standard of manhood from the Western viewpoint is lower than ours. and his treat- ment of women is likewise inferior. The high moral standards of the home are not carried beyond it. and even these high domestic standards are not proof against temptation in days of stress. when the man is often only too willing to save himself at the expense of his women- folk. Space forbids our enlarging further on the differences s between East and West. Probably the aptest and fairest way of describing the Chinese as a nation is to say-o they are a nation of children who stopped growing up at about the commencement of the Christian era.o They possess all the traits of children. They are kindly and yet in- sensately cruel. They are suspicious and yet responsive- and trustful. They are theatrical in almost everything they do. and yet capable of keen human emotion. They are cowardly and cringing and yet utterly self-sacrificing and loyal in service. They are lovers of fairy tales as children are. and foreign chil- dren brought up in their midst seem to have none of the difficulty experienced by their elders in getting to under- stand both them and their language. In fact. it is here that one can almost see the fatal process of absorption-o at work. Enough may have been said to show the diffi- culties under which the foreigner labours in his dealings with the Chinese. and to give perhaps some reason to the argument that there can only be one method of dealing with the problem. both in the interests of the foreigners
			and in the larger interests of the Chinese themselves. Acts of obstreperousness must be met by a show of force. and by actual force if necessary. There must be no hesitation and no show of compromise. Every action taken recently on these lines. by whatever Power. has been invariably and instantaneously successful. It is assuredly a big problem. and involves large and possibly international issues. But it must eventually be faced. and undoubtedly the sooner the better. As far as Great Britain is concerned. she has large interests in the East. outside of China. which can only be very adversely affected by a continuance of the present situation and present policy. Either Western civilisation must ad- vance. or at any rate be recognised. or else it must retreat and leave an entirely different and antagonistic civilisation in possession of the field. There can unfor- tunately be no alternative. and the world is becoming too linked and self-interdependent to permit of the per- manent isolation of a quarter of the globe's surface and a third of her inhabitants. An interesting query remains. If the above brief sum- mary is correct. how is it that China has held for so long a position in Western estimation to which she can hardly consider herself entitled How has she succeeded in throwing dust into the eyes of a nation which has had a unique experience in dealing with Eastern peoples and with weaker nations generally The answer is. perhaps. not far to seek. Her territory is so immense and so distant. and her population so enormous and so mixed. that she-still presents a somewhat terrifying picture to the foreigner (who until quite recently was confined to a few seaboard treaty ports) who has attempted to understand her. Her language. and particularly her written lan- guage. is a formidable one. and in the absence of a knowledge of the written language her reputed culture appeared likewise formidable. She has been. in fact. -wrapped in mystery-and mystery is generally formid- able. Added to this. her geographical position in the East i has given her a diplomatic importance in the eyes of Western Powers. and has attributed to her in consequence a somewhat factitious value. The fear engendered by the atmosphere of mystery surrounding the country and its inhabitants was still I-further accentuated by the-o Yellow Peril-o slogan which -swept through Europe after the defeat of Russia by the I-Japanese. The atmosphere of mystery surrounding China I-is now being rapidly dissipated. and it is becoming x03030-gradually clear that her salvation can only lie-in some I-despotic rule of the utmost firmness. No democratic I Government is possible in China. except in name. It is I-also clear that firmness must be shown by Western nations in their dealings with her. If this is not done. the future is assuredly an alarming one. not only for the -foreign Powers who have enormous interests in the I-country. but also for the teeming masses of her own population. who are the chief and helpless sufferers in the present chaos.

			Notes of the Week.
			Britain and the Steel Pact.-ox2014
			In view of tbe statements I
			made at the annual meetings of Dorman. Long and Cc.-. and the United Steel Company. our readers will not be surprised to learn that conversations have taken place- with regard to the joining of the Steel Pact by Great Britain. A glance at the figures of steel production for the last few years will. however. show clearly that the problem of Britain's appropriate quota is by no means an easy one. The first quarter of 1926. the production in which was taken as the basis of the quotas of the Conti- nental participants. was a most abnormal one for Great .-Britain. Indeed. there has hardly been what may be called a normal quarter for the British steel industry for some years past owing to one currency depreciation after another. the disturbance of the Ruhr occupation. mining strikes. 0c. The British steel industry could not possibly therefore enter into the agreement except on a basis which would take all factors into consideration. We understand that the present position is that British manu- facturers have indicated to the Continental manufacturers their idea as to what the British quota should be. and that
			this suggestion is under consideration. It is reported from Berlin that the-Continental manufacturers are pre- pared to concede us 8 million tons. but the British idea of a suitable quota is certainly higher than this. The discussion may take some time. for Britain's participa- tion would involve some revision of the terms of the present agreement. which in its turn means fresh consulta- tion between the various European participants. Even if the British trade did not get anything much better than the present Continental offer. a production of 8i million tens would be a great improvement on the-situation in which the British steel industry has found itself in recent times. But the Pact has to contemplate a comparatively normal state of affairs. and-the. Continental-manufacturers cannot afford to underestimate the possibilities of British competition. with its lasting assets of cheap coke. short rail hauls. and proximity to seaboard. Their proposal shows that they by no means regard our steel industry as down and out it is. however. very considerably below our capacity. which is commonly estimated at about 12 million tons a year-our actual-output in March last hav- ing been at the rate of gi million tons a year. The entry of the British steel trade into this international pact would only be. however. a first step. The industry is not to-day in a position to.-allocate production quotas or dis- tribute orders scientifically. and further steps in organisa- tion will be required if it is to carry out a bargain with its Continental competitors. If the present negotiations suc- ceed and the leaders of the industry take the responsi- bility of entering into an agreement of this kind. they will be compelled to take seriously in hand the work of in- ternal regulation. In a sense these negotiations are an attempt to build from the roof downwards. But if they lead to reorganisation they may open a new epoch in the history of the British steel trade.

			Monsieur Briand Takes the-Offensive.ox2014
			-From the inter-
			views which Monsieur Briand gave at the beginning of this week to representatives of the Journal and the Matin. with an eye to the reassembling of the Chambers next week. he would seem to contemplate offering a direct chal- lenge to Monsieur Poincare. In both Chambers he wants debates on his foreign policy-o not theoretical or general discussions. but clear and precise debates. so that there shall be a definite expression of opinion in regard to it. He hoped that those who were against Locarno would say what they proposed to substitute for the Govern- ment's conceptions.o He pointedly recalled that the Locarno policy had been carried through under his own Government. and added that other things had been done under the present Coalition Ministry. and that it was de- sirable for the Chambers to declare their opinion on these things likewise. It is-even more significant that he ap- parently described the Locarno agreements as being a development of the policy originally sketched out-by Mr Lloyd George and himself-at Cannes in 1922. Whether this claim can be substantiated is no doubt a matter of contention. Certainly the Cannes proposals did not contain that provision for reciprocity. as between France and Germany. which is the essence of the Locarno scheme. This. however.-is an historical question. and. in whatever way it is answered. the political import of Monsieur Briand's reference to Cannes in this connection is clear. The Cannes policy was upset by the Millerand-Poincare combination. Monsieur Millerand. who was then President of the Republic. abruptly recalled Monsieur Briand from Cannes. whereupon Monsieur Briand fell. Monsieur Mille- rand called Monsieur Poincare to office in order to carry out the policy of occupying the Ruhr. The reference to these old scores-o -and this at a time when MM. Poincare1 and Briand are colleagues-o -indicates two things-first. that Monsieur Briand has come to the conclusion that it is no longer possible for him to work with Monsieur Poincare in the spirit of the Locarno agreements- secondly. that. if he now challenges Monsieur Poincare on this issue. he has a reasonable chance of carrying the Chambers with him. The first conclusion would certainly seem to be war- ranted by the difficulties in Paris with which Monsieur Briand had to contend the other day during his successful -but only just successfulo-effort at Geneva to prevent a deadlock over the outstanding issues relating to German disarmament. The second point is one on which it is diffi-
			cult for foreigners to form any judgment. After the failure of the Ruhr policy. it seemed incredible to many foreign observers that Monsieur Poincare should have any political future. Yet once again he came back into power as the x03030 strong man -this time to save the franc and the sal- vaging of the franc-if it really has been salvaged beyond all danger of a relapse-is apparently regarded by many people in France as Monsieur Poincare's personal achieve- ment. Monsieur liriand's challenge may show next week how Monsieur Poincare's prestige in his own country actually stands to-day.

			Business and the Telephone.-ox2014
			-A correspondent I
			x03030writes-o - Yesterday saw the opening of the telephone service between London and New York. and this new achievement has aroused much controversy as to the merits of long-distance telegraphy and telephony. On the one hand there has been an emphasis upon the value of direct communication. lip to lip. as we may say- on the other hand. upon the security of the written word. and possibly upon the secrecy of the written word. The most surprising contribution has been made to the discussion in the annual report of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of the Irish Free State. Congratulating himself. as he had a right to do. on the reduction of the total deficit from i.-108.260 in 1922-3 to 411.038 last year. and promis- ing still further to reduce it to .o 350.000. he proceeded to give what we imagine is an apology for the reduction of postal and telegraph services. and he combined his subtle apology with a declaration that in twelve months time every town and village will have its telephone. Thus he seems to suggest that the telephone will take the place both of the post and of the telegraph. It may be that this will appeal to the particular psychology of Ireland. But it does not follow that a nation will prefer to speak rather than to write. Certainly the halfpenny advertising post (as we may call it) will remain. for we cannot believe that the January sales can be announced -satisfactorily to all and sundry by telephone. The truth is that the use of the telephone in commerce has yet to be studied. It is very doubtful if contracts actually are made by tele- phone. They are discussed. and they are brought to an issue. but it cannot be said that actually they are made. /It is true that in cases where there has been some corro- lborative evidence the courts have accepted a contract which was made by telephone. but to say this is not to claim that such contracts are day-by-day experiences. One administration did attempt a method of calling upon the operator to make a written record to which both speakers would be accessory. though this did not develop into a system. On the other hand. all over the world combinations have been evolved whereby the telephone is used in association with the telegraph and. especially. with the long-distance telegraph. It may be the case that business has adapted itself to these instantaneous means of communication. At one stage when the close of the New York market was of special importance to Ger- many. finance houses kept open in Germany until as late as nine o'clock. There must be limits to this type of adaptation. But if. as we are informed. London is to be in direct communication with Melbourne. we can hardly expect the financial and commercial houses in Australia .to turn night into day. Nevertheless. there is bound to be some movement towards the immediate transaction of business at some time of the day or night throughout the -world. We may leave our speculations at that point. Simultaneity of communication is the new feature. In its train it may bring changes of great economic pur- port.o As we go to press we hear that important use has been made of the first day's London-New York telephone facilities. We are informed that the Overseas Depart- ment of the Midland Bank was twice in communication -with the International Acceptance Bank of New York. and conducted important transactions in dollars. francs. lire. guilders. and marks.

			The Crisis in China.-ox2014
			The situation in China has once I
			again become menacing-o -indeed. at the moment it is perhaps more dangerous than at any time since-the un- happy Shanghai incident of 192S. and it has been deemed -necessary to evacuate all women and children from the I
			British Concession at Hankow. This danger does not arise from the Nationalist Government's hostile retort to the British Memorandum-o retort conveyed in a Note to the Government of the United States. Certainly this retort is disappointing. but it is not unexpected. The British Memorandum offered a deadly threat to the influ- ence of the Bolsheviks over the Nationalist organisation. This influence rests on the solid foundation of signal services rendered. and since the Bolsheviks cannot be expected to see it undermined without moving heaven and earth to keep it intact. and since. moreover. the Nationalists still depend on their Russian experts to help them win the civil war. it is all in the day's work that the Biitish Government's overture should meet with a first rebuff of this kind. This does not move us. since we do not for a moment believe that the last word has been said. The epoch-making character of the Memorandum. and the palpable sincerity with which it has been put forward. cannot but make a deep impression on the Chinese mind. if time is given for the full import of this new departure in policy to be realised. This. however. can be prevented by the creation of some-o incident -quite extraneous to the great questions at issue- and it is because the Bol- sheviks-and that element among the Nationalists which looks at the situation through their eyes-have an obvious interest in creating such an incident that the present extreme tension at Hankow is a matter of such anxiety. From the news of this week's events which has reached us up to date. it would seem that on the British side the situation at Hankow has been handled with admirable patience and sangfroid and. so far. the tactics (obviously the right tactics) of refusing the Nationalist extremistsl 1 the incident which they are apparently seeking have been pursued with success. No shot has yet been fired and when it proved impossible to keep the naval party I on shore without fighting. the policing of the British con- cession was handed over to the Chinese authorities. It is I significant that these authorities have accepted a responsi-I bility for law and order which is the logical consequence of their own pretensions. but which in this instance they apparently sought at first to evade. This may mean that I the delay. purchased by the admirable behaviour of thes British naval party. has given the moderates time tol check the designs of the extremist at the Nationalistl I headquarters. If so. an incident -may. after all. be averted and the British Memorandum may then be givenl x007C time to bear fruit. The situation at Hankow this week. is curiously like the situation at Chanak in 1922. In that case the cool-headedness of the British military authorities x007C on the spot saved the situation. At Hankow. the naval I authorities seem to be doing equally well. and this time their task is not being aggravated by any panicky action in London. I

			Four per Cent. Consols.ox2014
			I -There is as yet no officiall
			indication of the response that has been made to thei Government's offer of 4-per cent. Consols. It may. how- ever. be assumed that the cash applications have beenl satisfactory from the fact that the lists for cash subscrip- tions were closed on Wednesday morning instead of being kept open until Thursday. which was the day mentioned in the prospectus. A correspondent calls our attention I to the fact that in our last week's article on this issue we said that there is no price limitation attached to the Sinking Fund provisions. as is the case with the Wan Loan and Conversion Loan Sinking Funds. We should. of course. have said that there is no such price limita-j I tion so long as the stock is at or under par. I

			Portuguese Debt Settlement.ox2014
			-On the last day of the ole
			year Mr Churchill. on behalf of this country. and General Sinel-de Cordes. the Portuguese Minister of Finance. signed an agreement for the funding of Portugal's wai debt to Britain. According to the Finance Accounts. the total debt of Portugal to Britain at March 31st last wai 23.732.900. Under the new arrangement Portugal has the right to redeem the debt by a single payment ofj 5.500.000 before December 31. 1927. Alternatively. the settlement provides for the payment by Portugal or 62 annuities. as follows -o 125.000 for 1926. 250.0001 for 1927. 300.000 for 1928. 350.000 a year for thq
			years 1929 to 1938. 400.000 a year for the years 1939 to 1987. and 200.000 for 1988. The full text of the agreement. to be published later simultaneously in England and Portugal. is not yet available but the Government of Portugal is to be congratulated on this step towards settling its financial affairs on a definite basis. and also. we think. upon a just and favourable agreement.

			Home Railway Losses.-
			The returns of gross traffic I
			receipts of the British railways for the complete year 1926 are now available. and although we have to wait until the publication of the annual reports next month before the financial effects of the general strike and the coal stoppage can be ascertained. the decline shown in gross traffic re- ceipts for the year affords some indication of the problem now facing the railway directors -

			The unknown quantity which gives the key to the situation is the saving in expenditure. which the companies have been able to secure. firstly. by reductions in staffs. and. secondly. by reduced services. Economies resulting from the latter will to some extent. of course. have been offset by the high prices for the imported coal used when stocks of British coal were exhausted. But it has been estimated that in consequence of the strike a reduction of 4-per cent. in personnel has been made by the four great railways. giving a saving of roughly 3 millions on a wages bill of 86 millions. A year ago the ordinary dividends of the four companies required 13.593.000. the rates being - L.M.S.. 6 per cent.- L.N.E.R. preferred ordinary. 5-per cent.. and deferred i per cent. Great Western. 7 per cent.- Southern preferred ordinary. 5-per cent.. and de- ferred 3 per cent. Payments for 1927. will. of course. depend upon the extent to which the directors-think fit to distribute reserve and depreciation funds. At the end of 1926. the four companies withdrew 6.626.000 from re- serves. which means that only half the ordinary-dividends were earned. On the most optimistic basis net revenue for 1936-must be expected to show a decline of over 20 x22C50-millions. which means that heavy withdrawals will have to be-made to pay even the preference dividends by three of the companies. The Southern. which shows by far the smallest proportionate decline in traffics. only had to with- draw 200.000 from reserves a year ago. and will again apparently earn a margin sufficient to pay some of the 5 per cent. on the preferred ordinary before touching re- seives the prospects for the deferred shareholders are therefore comparatively good. The London and North Eastern. on the other hand. took 4 millions from reserve a year ago. net revenue falling short of the amount re- quired to cover the preference dividends by some 1.670.000. It is not surprising. therefore. that at mid- summer the usual interim dividend on the per cent. pre- ferred ordinary stock was not paid. the directors deferring consideration of the matter until the full year's results were known. This company's reserves and railway de- preciation funds stood in the last balance-sheet at 17 millions. against 34 millions held by the L.M.S.. 18 millions by the Great Western. and 8f millions by the Southern. It seems unlikely. therefore. that any distri- bution will be made this time on L.N.E.R. deferred ordinary stock. The rates to be paid on L.M.S. and Great j-Western ordinary stocks will. as we have said. depend upon the amounts which the directors decide to withdraw -from reserves.

			Bank Dividends.ox2014
			-The dividend announcements for the
			past year made this week by the English joint stock banks show no changes in comparison with 1925. This is in accordance with expectations. for although the turnover of money may have been smaller during the year owing to the industrial disturbances. money rates have been on a slightly more profitable basis. and the volume of loans and advances has been on a higher level. reaching record figures towards the end of the year. Some of this may have represented temporarily frozen credit owing to finan- cial embarrassment caused by the coal stoppage. and larger provision for bad and doubtful debts has probably been necessary. but the figures so far disclosed show in many cases an increase in net profits. and where-a decline is shown the amount is small. In the table below we show dividend rates for the past two years. together with yields at the latest prices -

The Midland makes no allocation to reserve. but 500.000 .is added to premises redemption account. against 600.000 a year ago. and the officers pension fund-is credited with 200.000. against 150.000 a year ago. The allocations made by the National Provincial are the same as a year ago. namely. 200.000 to con- tingencies. 100.000 to premises account. and 150.000 to pension fund. The profits of the District Bank and of Williams. Deacon's have declined by 8.800 and 14.000 respectively- those of the Lancashire and Yorkshire are some 19.000 higher. and the dividend is paid on a larger capital. a bonus distribution of 20 per cent. having been made twelve months ago.

			This decrease from the record figure of 1925 follows two-I .annual increases. and the total is still higher than that of i 1924. According to the official report. the decrease does not mean that fewer cheques were drawn. but that they I have been of smaller average amount indeed. all indi- 1 cations point to the fact that the cheque (in spite of the x007C fact that it still has to bear a-twopenny stamp) is becoming- more and more universally used as a means of settling i financial transactions.o The Inland Revenue figures of- x22C5 the yield of the twopenny stamp duty on cheques for the 1 latest financial year represent approximately ten cheques drawn per annum per head of the population. and about- 50 per cent. of these. it is computed. passed through the three London clearings. The decrease in the figures is 1 mainly due to the coal stoppage and the consequent dislo-. I cation of trade. This is shown more definitely in the-. I figures of the Country Cheque Clearing. for the turnover in the Town Clearing is so greatly influenced by large-. financial transactions. such as the moving of money in the 1 short loan market. Stock Exchange business. foreign ex- 1 change operations. financial movements in connection with new issues and the Unfunded Debt. that any reliable deduction therefrom as to the country's trade is very diffi- cult. A quarterly analysis of the Town Clearing figures shows that there was a decrease of 4.4 per cent. in the- first quarter. of 1.1 per cent. in the second. an increase of 2.2 per cent. in the third. and a decrease of 1.3 per cent. in the fourth. In the first quarter of 1925 there was an 1 increase slightly larger than the decline now recorded. 1 and this year's figure for the first quarter is practically-. I a reversion to the 1924 level. In the Metropolitan Clearing there was an increase of 2.1 per cent. in the first quarter. I and decreases of 3.3. 3. and 0.6 per cent. in the second. third. and fourth quarters respectively. It is satisfactory- to note that in this clearing the large increase of over 84- I millions recorded in 1925 over 1924 has only been lost to 1 the extent'of 20 per cent. The Country Cheque Clearing x0303 had'to bear the brunt of the disastrous effects of the coal-j I stoppage. which are particularly evident in the figures for-. the second and third quarters. which show declines of 6.8-. and 7.2 per cent. respectively. The first quarter's de- crease was quite small. namely. 1.6 per cent.. while in the I last quarter it was 3.3 per cent. of the eleven provincial 1 clearings. whose figures are supplied to the London Clear- ing House. Bradford alone shows an increase. and this to the trifling extent of o. i per cent. For the remainder I the declines ranged from 19.5 per cent. for Newcastle-on- Tyne. 15.8 per cent. for Manchester. and 14 per cent. for x0303 Liverpool. to 2.9 per cent. for Bristol. and 2 per cent.- for Leicester. Taking the aggregate for these clearings. the quarterly decreases were as follows -First quarter. 9.9 per cent.- second. 15.6 per cent.- third. 13. per cent.- fourth. 12.5 per cent. Only one record has been achieved I in the past year in the London Clearing. the total for the week ended January 6th being g68.8 millions. The record day and month totals are held by 1925 at 263.3 millions on April 30th. and 3.770.1 millions in January. The New York Clearing House for the year ended Novem- x22C5 ber 30. 1926. shows an approximate total 4s of 58.083 millions. an increase of y.953 millions.

			Report of the National Savings Committee.-
			-The Tenth I
			Annual Report of the National Savings Committee covers a year of satisfactory progress. Between April 1. 1925. and March 31. 1926. sales of Savings Certificates aggre- gated 43.894.537. as against 40.281.930 in 1924-25. the grand total of sales since the movement's inception in 1916 being nearly 766 million certificates. of an initial cash value of 598 millions. Of the latter amount some 222 millions (exclusive of interest) has been repaid or ex- changed for War Loan or other securities. leaving a net subscription to March 3ist last of 376 millions. In- clusive of accrued interest. the amount due to holders at that date was upwards of 475 millions. The significance of these figures is enhanced by the facts that individual holdings are limited to 5oo Certificates. and that during the decade the scheme has been in operation Post Office Savings Bank deposits have increased by 99 millions. and those of the Trustee Savings Banks by 32 millions. while the funds of the various societies under the super- vision-o of the Chief-Registrar-of Friendly Societies have
			t shown equally notable increases. Applications for repay- ment showed a slight decline during the twelve months covered by the Report. totalling 28.4 millions. or 7.69 per cent. of the value of Certificates outstanding at the beginning of the year. as compared with 29.5 millions (8.07 per cent.) in 1924-25. The Committee has long- and. in our opinion. rightly-regarded its function as an issuing house for a particular Government security as subordinate to the wider purpose of fostering a spirit-.of thrift in the land. On March 31st last 23.018 voluntary local Savings Associations were in existence (as against 21.252 a year earlier). More than half the total.were school associations. but the Committee has recently de- voted special attention to the question of increasing the number at work in business concerns. with encouraging results. over 1.100 such bodies being formed during the last six months covered by the Report. The movement is essentially democratic in its organisation. and those who believe that the country is the better for its work during the last ten years will await future reports with interest.

			The Sugar Outlook.ox2014
			Following the strong advance in
			November last chiefly due-to deterioration in some of the larger world's crops. and the decision taken in Cuba to. limit the yield to a maximum of 4t million tons. a lull ensued in the sugar market. Pending the signing of the Cuban Decree there was a mild reaction. On the definite Cuban news as to the crop curtailment and indi- cations of further rather serious deficiencies in the European crops. market conditions since the holidays have developed renewed strength. with prices for all descriptions of sugar moving up to new high records for the present movement. As compared with this time last year. the price of raw Cuban sugar c.i.f. New York indi- cates a appreciation of i cents per lb to about 3 cents. which compares with the lowest point touched in the past year of 2 cents and even less for the quantities that were dumped in the Far East at below the parity of the world's markets. White sugar Type A. which constitutes the basis of the London terminal market. touched at the worst of the depression last year. about i2s 6d per cwt. and rose this week to about 18s 8d. while fine I British granulated has been advanced from 28s to I 34s 70d. There has been an excellent demand for British- grown sugar for some time past and it is understood I that the factories have already cleared the bulk of their available stocks in most cases. so that the position of I home refiners of imported raw sugar is now better to that I extent. There is not. moreover. much Czechoslovakian I granulated sugar to come over in the current season. In place of the superabundant supplies of the past two I seasons the world's markets are now confronted with a rather serious shortage. while calculations as to crop I yields have been badly upset within the last three months. I About a month ago it was estimated that there would be a deficit of roughly one million tons for the season in the I total world's resources. but it now looks as though the total deficit will be about 1.300.000 tons. if the Cuban crop is placed at 4J million tons. Even assuming that the Cuban Government modify their programme of restric- tion to some extent. so as to utilise the great bulk of their I cane resources later in the season to meet an active I European demand at higher prices. the outlook for the I next few months is strongly in favour of producers. It is rather doubtful whether the world's resources this season will exceed 23 million tons. which would compare with 24.300.000 tons and 23.623.000 tons respectively for the two previous seasons. Mr F. O. Licht's estimates of the European- crops have undergone another revision. the total being given as only 6.840.000 metric tons. as against 7.470.832 tons for the previous season. This. therefore. indicates a deficit of 630.832 tons. The de- mand for some time past from the Eastern trades. includ- ing the Far East. has been quite active. and heavy quan- tities of old Cuban sugar were also absorbed in that quarter. while the current Java crop shows a deficit of nearly 300.000 tons as compared with the previous one. American consumption for the past vear has been esti. I 1-mated up to about 5.600.000 tons. I

			New Life Assurance Business.-
			-Last week we were able
			to give the 1926 figures of new life assurance business for the Norwich Union. the National Mutual Association of Australasia. and the National Mutual Society of London. This week the figures of the-o -Old Equit- able.o the Royal Exchange. the Scottish Provident. the Legal and General. the Phoenix. the Pearl. and the London Life are available. The general tendency of the figures is one of expansion. The new life business of the Old Equitable-o at 1.000.-000 exceeds the 1925 total. The Royal Exchange records a figure of 1.998.700. or 26.507 more than in the previous year. The Scottish Provident's figure is 2.290.706. while the Legal and General wrote more new life business than in any previous year. the total net sums assured being 5.243.824. against 3.81-1.561 for 1925-o truly remark- able increase. The new business of the life department of the Phoenix for 1926 was 2.670.000. or 410.000 more than in the previous year. and the Pearl's huge total of 9.157.904 shows an advance of about 80.000. The London Life Association gives a total of 1.925.392.

			Bonus on Whole Life Policies.ox2014
			-In. last-week's issue we I
			referred to the announcement by the National Mutual Life Assurance Society (of London) to the effect that the board had decided on this occasion to allot an additional compound bonus of 6s per cent. to whole life with-profit policies. over and above the 44s per cent. bonus granted alike-to whole life policies and to endowment assurance policies. This announcement. which indicates an interest- ing and important departure from established practice. follows no doubt from two papers read recently before the Institute of Actuaries by Mr C. R. V. Coutts. F.I.A.. and Mr G H. Recknell. F.I.A.. F.F.A. The former of these gentlemen is the actuary and manager of a well- known life office. and was at one time the assistant actuary of the National Mutual Society. whilst the latter is-the society's present assistant actuary. The investiga- tions described in these two papers indicated clearly that at existing rates of premium the continuous improvement in mortality (experienced both by the general population and by the lives assured in life offices) no longer justifies the same rate of bonus for all classes of policy. or even for different policies in the same class. In particular. the tendency towards greater longevity enables whole life policies to earn somewhat larger profits than endowment assurances. By differentiating as it has done in the allocation of bonus. the National Mutual does something to restore equilibrium and satisfy equity. at least between the two classes. The decision is obviously in the nature of an adjustment. and is not in any way an attempt to discriminate against endowment assurance policies. which probably receive already all that they are entitled to. if not a little more. Again. the society does not apparently bind itself to maintain a difference of 6s. per cent. in the bonuses of the two classes. but reserves freedom either to increase or to diminish the difference as future circum- stances-demand. The National Mutual is to be congratu- lated alike on the promptitude which always marks its bonus announcements. and on its enterprise in being the first .life office to give effect to the most recent actuarial researches. Incidentally. it may be that the higher bonus to whole life policies may do something to restore their popularity-a consummation which is regarded by many authorities as eminently desirable.

			Co-operative Sales.-
			-The report of the Co-operative I
			Wholesale Society. which will be considered at the dele- gate meetings to-day. affords evidence of the lowered purchasing power of the members of the retail societies. due to the industrial conditions prevailing in the quarter ending September 25th. The sales. writes a corre- spondent. were 16.968.016. a decrease of 1.160.953 on the corresponding period of 1925. From the C.W.S. productive works the supplies were 6.111.464. a de- crease of 366.232. The deposits and withdrawals of the C.W.S. Bank were 148.960.041. an advance of 4.616.743. to which the operations of 8.434 trade union i current accounts greatly contributed. The decreases in I-trade were fairly generally distributed. being felt most-. I-severely in the Newcastle area. where the decrease was x03030-nearly 14 per cent. In Manchester-o district responsible
			for half the C.W.S. turnover-o -the decrease was 41. and in the London area it was only ioox00A3 per cent. The directors observe that practically one-fifth of the decrease in sales was represented by the reduced coal transactions. With the prospect of industrial peace they are hopeful that the sales will shortly be fully restored. and that greater indus- trial activity will soon place them in the position of show- ing the periodical trade increases that have been custo- mary. Two societies are applying for membership of the C.W.S.-o -viz.. the Esthonian C.W.S. and the Worcester- shire Farmers. Limited. thus emphasising the advance of international co-operation and the interest of the British farmers in the consumers movement.

			The Mint Eeport.ox2014
			The fifty-sixth annual report of the
			Deputy-Master and Comptroller of the Royal Mint for the year 1925 is of more than usual interest. since the gold standard was restored in April of that year. and the report deals at some length with the technical side of the matter. The total of new gold coin struck by the Mints of the Empire in 1925 exceeded 20 millions. The London Mint's total of 3.518.000 represented the recoining of light-weight coins which had been accumu- lating for several-years at the Bank of England. while the Australian Mints coined over 10 millions-the highest amount since 1918-o -and the Pretoria Mint 5.833.900. No gold bullion was received from the Bank of England for coinage during 1925. The issues of new Imperial gold coin from the branch Mints in Australia and South Africa amounted to 16.664.800. against 2.139.400 in 1924. The new silver coin issued from the London Mint amounted to 1.739.802. against 2.174.209 in 1924. The nominal value of the silver coin of 925 fineness with- drawn from circulation by the Mint in 1925 was 2.490.444. including 317.741 withdrawn in Australia and South Africa and melted and sold to the Common- wealth and Union Governments as bullion. The with- drawal during the previous year was 3.236.371. Im- perial bronze halfpence and farthings were issued on about the same scale as in 1924-o -about 10 and 11 million pieces respectively-but. in order to keep some check upon the steadily increasing numbers of halfpence in circulation. it was again found possible. during extended periods of the year. to refer applicants for these in the London area to one or other of the big banks. Again. no neces- sity arose for the striking of pence. Indeed. only some 500 value in this denomination was issued to the Colonies. Home demands were entirely supplied from the accumulated stocks held bv banks or business firms. while 55.000 value in worn bronze was withdrawn from circulation. The general account of expenses and receipts of the Mint for 1925 shows an excess of expenditure over receipts amounting to .o 87.925. as against an excess of 223.533 in the previous year. A profit of 37.000 was effected on the silver coinage. as compared with a loss of 106.600 in 1924. From extra receipts a sum of over 200x007Co- millions was appropriated in aid of the Mint Vote and 401.000 paid over to the Exchequer.

			The New Stock-Exchange Rule.ox2014
			-The new Stock
			Exchange rule which has come into force this week was mentioned when it was first passed early last October (Econornist. October i6th. p. 625). It forbids a member to share commission on business introduced by an agent who advertises for Stock Exchange business in the public Press in this country. Northern Ireland. or-the Irish Free State. and as a piece of Stock Exchange legislation it is probably the most important action which the Committee took during 1926. It deserves to be noticed that the rule is not aimed at anyone in particular. although it is bound to affect a large class of people doing business in Stock Exchange securities who stand outside the range of the House. Precisely how it will affect the banks it is hard to say. The banks. which are the principal collectors and distributors of Stock Exchange business after Stock Ex- change members themselves. may have to modify their present practices in some respects. for banking- advertise- ments in the public Press have made references to the fact that the banks transact Stock Exchange business. and it is commonly known that they accept 50 per cent. x22C50-H.M. Stationery Office. 6s-6d-net.
			of the gross commission on orders which they introduce to the Stock Exchange broker. The bucket-shops are obviously. if obliquely. indicated in the rule. although the latter does not lay down in precise terms any direct warn- ing against clients dealing with advertising firms. There are brokers. non-members of the Stock Exchange. who do considerable business in stocks and shares mainly through the medium of advertisement. not always. how- ever. in the public Press. but through the facilities offered by the Post Office. It has to be observed that the new rule does not forbid brokers dealing for people who adver- tise for Stock Exchange business. but simply prohibits them. the brokers. from sharing commission with the outsiders. This enables the outsider to use the Stock Exchange. if it serves his purpose. as a convenient means for the exercise of his business. for it is easy enough to imagine circumstances in which it would profit the out- sider to be treated as an ordinary client. and to pay full commission. There are outside houses which thrive upon the conduct of a business that appeals to men and women not in close touch with City affairs. but who consider themselves too astute to be caught by the glaring red-ink puffs of the bucket-shop. pure and simple-assuming. in- cidentally-. that a bucket-shop can be either. These out- side houses will take lines of stock in various companies and peddle it out amongst their customers in very much the same way as New York bankers. financial houses. and similar institutions dispose of blocks of perfectly sound securities in the United States. Where the cases differ lies in the fact that in America for many of these bonds so issued there is a tolerably free market. and the holder is not compelled to resort to the original vendor if he should wish to sell. In this countrv the trouble is that where outsiders place amongst their clients stocks. bonds. and shares in some company permission to deal in whose securities has not been granted by the London Stock Ex- change Committee. the investor finds himself in the posi- tion of being unable to get any sort of reasonable bid at all. There is no Stock Exchange market- there is no- body to whom he can go for a bid except the people from whom he bought the stock. and the result is that the dis- illusioned buyer receives a lesson in the value of market- ability such as he never understood before he came to realise it through the bitter experience of finding himself left with stock in which no free market exists. The new Stock Exchange rule should do much to counteract the evil effects of this class of business. and it ought to prove the means for affording the public greater protection and safeguard in the conduct of their financial affairs.

			Swiss Wheat Monopoly.-ox2014
			- A Geneva correspondent I
			writes -Early in December a proposal made by I the Swiss Federal Government for establishing a State I monopoly on wheat was defeated by the electorate by 371.309 votes against 369.103 and by 14 cantons against eight. This decision is not only a verdict against the wheat monopoly. but also against the whole principle of State monopoly it is. furthermore. a severe indictment of nationalisation and Government centralisation. and a plea in favour of federalism and freedom of commerce. Wheat was a Government monopoly throughout the war. but its subsequent maintenance was unconstitutional. and rested only on the emergency powers with which the Federal Council was invested. The Government. in fact. requested the electorate to legalise the existing state of affairs by introducing the principle of monopoly into the Constitution. and this was refused. Up to now all wheat imported has been controlled by the Federal Trade Office at Berne. and the consequence is that wheat is more ex- pensive in Switzerland than in other countries. that bread costs more. and is of inferior quality. For example. the average price for Manitoba No. i wheat was the following (in gold francs) in Switzerland and London -
			8witzerland. London. Frs. Frs. 1921 48.48 33.98 1922-.......................... 39.48 28.75 1923-.......................... 36.09 24.91 1924-..........................-34.79 27.87 1925 43.39 35.81 1926-.......................... 39.75 33.55
			Even after deducting from the Swiss prices a sum of four I to five francs. representing the transport and other costs. t
			the London prices are lower than those of the Swiss monopoly. The wheat-question is ery important for Switzerland. which hardly produces enough to satisfy the home consumption for tive months. An average of 100.000 acres devoted to wheat in the years 1912-16 was increased to 193.000 in 1917 and 257.000 in 1919. but it has since decreased to 223.000 acres in 1926. Imports of wheat reach nearly 340.000 tons a year. and foreign wheat is cheaper than-the home produce. With the object of encouraging the home production. the Government buys wheat from the peasants at an average price of 6of per 100 kilogrammes. while the peasants can buy flour at 481 or 5of per 100 kilogs. Bread now costs 60c per kilo- gramme in Switzerland. as against 49c in Berlin. 45c in Prague. 38c in Paris. The Government's proposal was backed by the Socialists and Agrarians. and generally opposed by the bourgeois parties. The supporters held the view that State control would encourage home pro- duction and assure the revictualling of the country. while. at the same time. by making im.portant purchases at the right moment. the Government might make a profit and consequently lower the price of bread. The view of the opponents was that the home culture of wheat can be encouraged by other means. and that the peasants can be assured that their wheat will be bought at a good price without having recourse to a monopoly. They also laid stress on the fact that. during the past years. the Govern- ment speculated on wheat and that. on several occasions. emergency supplies were insufficient. It was also pointed out that if the Government was sustaining losses as a result of unlucky speculations the taxpayer would be called upon to pay the deficit. Moreover. the experience of the last few years shows that State control does not make bread cheaper-on the contrary. It was also insisted that the maintenance and legalising of the wheat monopoly would result in an increase in the number of Government officials. The Government is now making new arrange- mer.ts that will make it possible to stimulate the home production and to purchase wheat from the peasants at such a price that will make that culture profitable.

			British Controlled Oilfields.-
			-Nearly four months ago
			I-the directors of this company issued one of the most sen- sational documents in the history of company finance.
			The most important point in that statement (discussed I in the Economist of September i8th) was that two-thirds x03030of the capital of g millions had been definitely lost. The shares. which slumped to low levels. have latterly recovered a few shillings on the news of better outputs in those of the company's fields which are productive. and the annual report. issued this week. was awaited with unusual interest. Since the issue of the September state- ment Lord Buckmaster has resigned the chairmanship and has been succeeded by Mr J. W. Dennis. The report t is complementary to the September document. and does not traverse the old ground again. except in so far as it insists upon the necessity for -remodelling the financial structure of the company.o for which a scheme is appar- ently in preparation. Presumably the phrase quoted covers both financial reconstruction and amendment of the anomalous administrative arrangements. As regards the actual financial results of the year ending July 31st last. the figures show decided improvement. The profit for the year. after deducting the whole of the company's expenditure and a sum of $425.594 for depreciation. is x03030$1.993.136. and after sundry other deductions have been made. a net balance of $1.678.801 remains. against $1.262.235 for the previous year. This raises the total to the credit of profit and loss account to $2.937.284. Other interesting points in the report are the announcement that the agreement with the Standard Oil Company has x030300-with some reservations been terminated as from Novem- ber 30th last that negotiations with regard to the Trini- dad properties have been opened with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and that the company's production has risen from 30.000 barrels a week in early February to 57.500 barrels a week at the end of November. The best that can be said is that the report relieves a little of the deep gloom cast by the September statement. The posi- tion is. perhaps. best summed up by the concluding sen- tences of the reporto-o This report will. in the opinion of your directors. be regarded as showing a distinct im- provement in the technical and in the commercial posi- tion-of the company. and it is clear that from part of the x03030company's properties the shareholders may have good hopes for the future. But it is equally clear that in respect of others of the properties much of this company's capital has been lost. and that the company's financial structure must be drastically remodelled. This matter has received the earnest consideration of your board. and the com- pany's lawyers have been instructed to consider and advise how reconstruction can best be carried out.o The market liked the report well enough to mark up both classes of shares slightly.

			Mexico Mines.-
			-Our mining correspondent writes- The I
			report of the Mexico Mines of El Oro shows a net profit of only .o 53.106. as against 102.600 for the year ended June. 1925. After the payment of dividends totalling 4s per share tax free. in place of 7s. the somewhat en- hanced balance of 105.300 remains to go forward. For the first half of the current year the dividend is only 9d per share. In their 1925 report the directors made no secret of the fact that recent exploratory work had in the main been attended with discouraging results-a point emphasised in our Note of a vear ago. A similar statement is again made. with the addition that the remaining reserves are nearing exhaustion. and the management is of the opinion that -the limits of payable ore have been reached. both laterally and in depth.o At 112.700 tons. value $8 gold and 6.4 ozs silver. the ore reserves show a further serious falling off in both x22C50quantity and value the former represents no more than nine months supply for the mill. In these circumstances it appears at first sight a little surprising that the price of the shares should be maintained at about 2os-albeit this compares with 32s 6d twelve months back. The explana- tion is that the balance-sheet shows surplus cash assets to the tune of 184.000. or 17s. 6d. per share. Then the plant. machinery. and the timber property. upon which 436.100 has been expended. figure at nothing. It is. i therefore. probable that liquidation would provide some- thing in excess of the current market price of the shares.
			Mount Lyell.-Attention continues to be practically con- fined to the North Lyell section of the property. although it would appear that no further development work has been performed here. the ore reserve estimate of 898.100 tons being arrived at by deduction of the ore taken out during the year. less 10.000 tons obtained from other sources. The quantity of copper produced totalled 6.860 tons. as against 6.480 tons in the year ended September. 1925. the yield of gold and silver being much the same as before. A further improvement in the metallurgical prac- tice is reported. However. at 608.800 the-o blister. copper and chemical works account -shows only a modest increase-the result. presumably. of the necessity of purchasing superphosphate in order to meet require- ments. As regards the metal. there is the interesting point that more than one-half the output was consumed within the Commonwealth. and it appears probable that a much larger proportion will be taken in the near future. As regards the chemical. measures have been taken both to increase the manufacturing capacity and to ensure adequate supplies of rock. During the year 75.000 shares in the Wallaroo-Mount Lyell Fertilisers. Limited. were disposed of on what the directors describe as satisfactory terms-o - part of the proceeds has been applied in reduction of the valuation of shares held in other companies. and part brought into profit and loss account. After the provision of somewhat enhanced amounts for prospecting. depreciation. 0c.. the net profit figures at 171.900. as against -174.600. Once again the final dividend and bonus of is 3d per share make a total of 2s 3d for the year. On this basis the shares yield about 8 per cent.

			Oversea Correspondence.
			LEAGUE OF NATIONS.-SEVENTH ANNIVERSARYoox2014 RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT.
			(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) GENEVA. January 4. THE seventh anniversary of the League of Nations (January 10th) finds the League's authority more firmly established than at any other time during its short exist- ence. This is. of course. mainly due to the entry of Germany. which has put an entirely new face on the or- ganisation. but that was the culmination of a long. steady. and up-hill progress rather than a sudden and isolated access of strength. Those who would have had the world believe that the League was negligible without Germany would have made it a League not worth while for Germany if they had had their way. yet now they speak of the League as a thing fashioned by their own hands. The truth of the matter is rather that the League had become an essential instrument. and. but for bungling on the part of the Allies. Germany could not have remained outside. The blunder- ing preliminary to the special March Assembly only just failed to have fatal effects. and was saved from such disaster largely by the good sense and moderation of the German Foreign Minister. He had been the first to act on the theory that Locarno meant. or should mean. newer and better methods. As it was. much better results could have been reached if matters had been properly handled in March. and lack of decision and ordinary foresight led to a settlement in September which was not altogether satisfactory. the absurd factor being that the less accept- able solution arrived at failed to achieve its purpose of keeping Spain and Brazil within the fold. For good or ill. there it is- Sir Austen Chamberlain. at any rate. has been careful to find no fault with the Council as it is. but perhaps he is not an altogether objective observer. and he has shown resentment at the notion that the Assembly should give signs of any views of its own on this or other matters.
			There is no doubt that there has been some exaggeration of the superior moral outlook of the Assembly. What it all amounts to is that there are three or four States.in the happy position of being rather outside the risks of foreign policy. and they can take a square League view. This is a great advantage to the League. and if properly and con- sistently made use of is capable of insisting upon certain public standards of policy and of keeping to the front the enlightened opinion of the world. But when that is said. it is as well to note that when one or other of these States are involved in League problems of serious concern to themselves. they behave just like other imperfect mortals. The -world conscience-o supposed to be resident in the Assembly of 56 Government representatives is one of those surviving notions amongst which there are so many that have put a screen in front of the realities. The develop- ments of the past year or two have tended to disperse the mists hanging over the League. which is more and more obviously a business concern of Governments living not in the clouds. but on the very hard ground of real politics. This is a truism which is less of a shock to hot-gospellers now than it would have been some time ago it requires emphasising. not because enthusiasm should be damped down. but because enthusiasm should have a balanced regard for the fact that the League as it has become more authoritative has also approached some of its stiffest tasks. Let it be said in passing that whatever criticisms may be levelled at Governments as a whole. and whatever discount may be put on rhetorical lip-service. the majority of the Governments in the League have carried through League work. especially in the earlier days. not only without any pressure of public opinion. but often in face of public opinion rather hostile and cynical. That is not so much the case now. because the work done by the League is such that none who likes to consider himself informed on world affairs. or even on his. own country's foreign relations. can afford to be ignorant-of it. In fact. it has done too much for some people-and some Governments-and a dangerous ten- dency indicated by several signs during the past twelve months is an attempt to slacken the pace (by methods sometimes lacking in candour). and. so to speak. to keep the League in its proper place.o There is preva- lent in some quarters an idea that the League is there to be invoked when it is convenient to do so. but that it must be prevented. if possible. from becoming an incon- venient brake on designs that can more easily be promoted without having to pass through any gauntlet of League discussion in relation to principles. This-.danger can be avoided. and probably will be. as the Covenant can be invoked by any State. even Abyssinia. which has a griev- ance. The side-tracking policy can be more subtly pur- sued in directions like mandates administration. but not easily. if public opinion behind the Mandates Commission is-worth anything. An unknown factor in these con- sideration is Germany's general attitude. which will be extremely important. It is not possible yet to form a firm opinion there have been indications both ways. Last year's experience. however. justifies prudent opti- mism. Undoubted and definite progress has been made in substance and in outlook. Black spots. of course. there are. and enormous problems are ahead. Two of the greatest immediate problems before the League are the tasks to be undertaken by the Disarmament Conference and the General Economic Conference. Considerable pro- gress has been made. and while it has been possible to prepare the ground sufficiently to summon the Economic Conference for May next. the Disarmament Conference is not yet sufficiently prepared for a decision to be taken on the date. It differs from the Economic Conference in that it is useless to summon it before there is a reason- able prospect of a convention. whereas the Economic Conference is more in the nature of a world consultation. To those who may imagine that that is of limited practi- cal value. it should be recalled that the Brussels Finan- cial Conference of 1920 was followed by the Austrian Reconstruction Scheme. the Hungarian Reconstruction Scheme. the so-called Dawes plan. and various other schemes. several of which. like the Bulgarian refugee scheme and the Estonian and Danzig reform schemes -all. with the exception of the Dawes plan. involving loans under League auspices-were put through during
			the year just closing. The Economic Conference might well be another starting-point of a similar kind in its proper field. The preparation for the Disarmament Con.. ference is covering enormous ground. Studies have been made into a variety of questions. including several of extreme importance on some constitutional aspects of the League in regard to security. as well as. more strictly speaking. organising aspects in the same connection. It is an interesting reflection. incidentally. that though the Covenant made a big advance on pre-war conditions by providing for the summoning of a League meeting in case of emergency. and though in one emergency the Council met within three days of an appeal. further measures have been taken to ensure speeding up to the highest point possible it shows a certain satisfactory determination to make the fullest use of the peace-pre- serving provisions of the Covenant. especially as it is coupled with a new study into the preventive measures which might be employed under Article XI. The League has been active in nearly every field- transit. finance. economics. health. international law. mandates. 0c.-and two issues. completely differing in character. but each indicative of developing spirit. have been settled in the year. One was the removal of some objectionable features of the League's investigation scheme to be kept ready for use if called upon when the inter-Allied military control of Germany ceases at the end of this month. The other was the refusal-bluntly speaking-to give preferential treatment to the United States or to weaken the Court Statute in order to secure America's adhesion to the Permanent Court of Inter- national Justice.

			UNITED STATES.ox20140-STEEL DIVIDEND-STRONG MARKETS-GOOD BUSINESS OUTLOOKoox20140-PRICE MOVEMENTS.
			I (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) NEW York. December 27. A FURTHER show of strength in the markets has followed the announcement. on December 16. by the directors of the United States Steel Corporation of-their intention of recommending to stockholders. for action at the April meeting. the declaration of a 40 per cent. stock divi- dend on the common shares. The announcement. which came after the close of trading. caused a tremendous turnover in Steel Common during the next day's trading on the Stock Exchange. Trading went ahead at such a tremendous pace that over 400.000 shares had been traded in before the close of the first hour. By three o'clock. when trading ceased for the day.-well over 600.000 shares of the stock had been turned over. this setting a new high record for a day's trading in a single stock. On this tremendous volume the fluctuation in price was surprisingly small. Most of the heavy trading of the first hour was done within a fraction of a point and just below 159. After the-initial profit-taking had been absorbed the stock moved up to a new high record for all time at i6ooox007Co. In the next few days the market in Steel quieted down. and the shares settled back to about 156. To-day. in a demonstration of general strength. they again sold above 160. Mean while the rest of the market has pushed ahead to new. high levels. Railroad shares have been conspicuously strong. partly on the strong investment demand for this type of security. and partly on further increases in divi- dends and declarations of bonuses. Atchison. Topeka. and Santa Fe rose strongly to above 170 (this comparing with the year's lowest level of 122) on anticipations that at the January meeting of the directors the dividend basis will be increased from $7 to -to a share. As the road earned more than $20 a share last year and is expected to earn about S25 this year. and as over -100 a share has been ploughed back into the property out of earnings during the last ten years. this expectation is not extravagant. Those of a bullish tendency cite the Atchison case as an instance supporting the theory that all the good news is not out yet. Meanwhile the motor shares have again come forward on the belief that with the show season starting soon. a new buying movement in cars is about to begin and oils have been firm on the
			excellent results that this year's statements are expected to show. While the steel dividend cannot be called a surprise to those who are familiar with the corporation's affairs. as the tremendous accumulated surplus. extremely strong cash resources. and unequalled competitive position of .the corporation plainly made a generous distribution pos- sible. the secret of the moment was well kept. A de- cision in the matter apparently had been left in Judge x03030Gary's hands. and the chairman apparently did not make his intentions known until he met with the members of the finance committee two days before the public an- nouncement was made. During those two days the secret was perfectly kept. so that no one in the market had advance information of what was coming. Nothing was said in the official announcement as to the dividend basis for the new shares. but it is taken for granted that the directors will place them on a $7 basis. as Judge Gary some time ago intimated that no increase in capi- talisation would take place until the extra cash dividends could be safely covered. Assuming that the $7 divi- dend will be maintained on the increased capitalisation. the new cash distribution will amount to $9.80 a share on the present common stock. At 160 this corresponds to a yield basis slightly better than 6. per cent. Good judges regard the proposed action as conservative. as iess than 40 per cent. of the corporation's accumulated surplus will be capitalised. and the corporation has earned more than $10 a share in each of the past ten years except the two post-deflation years of 1921 and I 1922. and probably will earn better than $17 a share this year. Meanwhile. it is pointed out that Judge Gary Is I a very conservative man. and that with such eminent financiers as Mr J. P. Morgan and Mr George F. Baker on his directorate. the present action certainly would not be proposed if depression was likely to develop. The-decision to have the dividend has been interpreted as reflecting expert opinion to the effect that reasonably good busi- ness lies ahead. and it has done much to confirm the greater confidence that has been felt since the share market began to revive convincingly from the October break. As for industrial news. there has been nothing very decisive that is new. Nothing decisive is to be expected. however. at this time of year. when the big factories are shutting down for year-end inventories. and when the quieting effects of midwinter are being felt. Consump- tion of steel apparently has been holding up well for the season. and the trade is feeling more hopeful with regard to a pick-up in new buying. The railroads have a great deal of cash. as their earnings continue excellent. and are buying track supplies freely and equipment moderately. The automobile makers are getting ready for the spring campaign. and several of them are bring- ing out new models for showing at the annual exhibitions which start in January. Henry Ford has declared his in- tention of sticking to his present model despite the severe inroads on his business that his competitors have made x22C50during the past few years. Ford's proportion of the total business has dropped during this period from approximately two-thirds to one-third of the total busi- ness. The loss has been both relative and absolute. At the present moment his competitors are making fresh plans to expand their competing lines during the coming year. the Chevrolet unit of the General Motors Corpora- tion having enlarged capacity to a 4.000 car a day basis. The present year will be an important one in the Ford business and an extremely competitive one for the auto- mobile business generally. At the same time. generous rewards will probably be reaped by the successful com- petitors. as public purchasing power is high. Year-end prophecies of business conditions bv bankers and industrialists are taking an optimistic line. The possibility of a slowing down in business from the high level of the past twelve months is seen. but confidence Is expressed in the soundness of the economic and finan- cial situations. There are words of caution over instal- ment buying. and there is some emphasis on the drop in the price of farm products. On the other hand. the absence of inflation. either of prices or inventories. is favourably commented on. and-the efficiency of industry Is praised. Nothing like credit strain exists easier
			money and rising bond prices are. in fact. expected. In short. most of our business men and bankers seem to feel that if caution continues to be exercised. good busi- ness will be enjoyed. Further softness in commodity prices was reflected by the Bureau of Labour Statistic Index for November. the level for that month being i per cent. lower. at 148. i-per cent. of the 1913 average. than that for Octo- ber. The new level is 6 per cent. below that for November. 1925. and is much the lowest in two years. The chief declines were in agricultural products.

			FRANCEoox20140-NEW YEAR OUTLOOK-REDUCTION OF DEBT TO THE BANKoox20140-TREASURY BOND ISSUE- UNEMPLOYMENT.
			(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS. January 5. FOR France the new year appears to have opened with rather mixed prospects. but on balance the outlook is vastly better than it was twelve months ago. As far as the national finances are concerned. the situation has im- mensely improved during the past six months. and there is now every prospect that. bar accidents. M. Poincare will be able to carry to a successful conclusion the rest of the programme laid down by the Experts Committee. The possibility that this country may be called upon in the near future to begin. at any rate. paying off its debt to the United States. just as it has actually begun to carry out the provisional agreement made last year between Mr Winston Churchill and M. Raoul Peret. is no longer a seriously disturbing factor. It may even be regarded as negligible. provided politicians will allow the question to be dealt with on its merits. and will not insist on using it for merely party purposes. Here. again. time and the force of things are contributing. as the weeks go by. to bring about a satisfactory and rational solution. The role of Fabius Cunctator is not the least successful of those M. Poincare has fulfilled during his long political career.
			By avoiding battle in the Chamber hitherto. and leaving the dangerous issues of ratification of the Washington and London agreements and the reform of the electoral system (by a return to the old method of scrutin arron- dissement) until lime and calm reason have made their influence felt. plus the application of a whole string of successful financial remedies. M. Poincare has assured the road to success. The outstanding events of the week comprise the ful- filment of the statutory obligation to reduce the debt due to the Bank by 2.ooo.ooo.ooof the issue. for tactical purposes.o as from January ist. of 5.000.000.00of of addi- tional Treasury bonds- and the suppression of the turn- over tax on the bulk of French exports. Under the law passed by the previous Poincare Govern- ment. it will be remembered. it was enacted that every year the amount owing to the Bank should be reduced. on or before December 31st. by 2.000 millions. and that simul- taneously the legal maximum obtainable by the Treasury from this source should automatically be similarly lowered. Hitherto it has generally been found impossible to con- form to this law. The extent of 10I. Poincare's success during the past six months may be gauged by the fact that last July. when the Herriot Government fell. the maximum of 38.500.000.0001 had actually been reached. and that the Government was warned in writing by the Bank that unless steps were immediately taken to arrange for powers to be given permitting further advances to be made. payment of Treasury cheques and drafts must be refused. as from the next morning. Last Thursday's Bank statement showed that. as the result of 450.000.000f having been re- paid to the Bank during the previous seven days. the total debt had been reduced to exactly 36.000.-000.-ooof. On the following day M. Poincare wrote informing the Bank that the Treasury proposed to effect the statutory end-of-the- year reduction forthwith. Theoretically. the funds for this statutory reduction are secured from surpluses arising dur- ing the year from the ordinary sinking fund. On De- cember yst these balances totalled 1.332.-000.-ooof. so that the total actually to be found by the Treasury from other sources was. in round figures. 668.000.-ooof only. By this repayment the total of the debt was reduced from 36.-000.-000.-ooof to 34.-coo.-000.-ooof. and the legal authorised maximum which the State may borrow from the Bank has been simultaneously brought drown from 38.500.000.-ooof to 36.-500.-000.-ooof-. at which figure it should remain in the ordinary course until the end of 19.-27. when the law requires that it shall again be reduced by 2.000 millions. To-morrow's Bank statement will show that during the week the Treasury borrowed a total of 1.000 millions to meet the usual end-of-the-month and end- of-the-year payments. so that the total debt. as compared with the full 38.-500.-000.-ooof when the Herriot Govern- ment left office last July. now stands at exactly 35.-000.-000.-ooof. The present margin of 1.500 millions should be ample to meet all probable contingencies. as the Treasury is now furnished with abundant resources in other directions. quite apart from the Bank. The total note issue has been increased during the past week by 1.-398.039.-ooof. and now totals 54.-305.-368.-ooof. The maximum authorised limit of issue being 58.500.000.000 there is now a margin. in round figures. of 4.200 millions. which is also satisfactory. The fact that it has been found necessary. in spite of all the emphasis which is being placed on the importance of reducing the floating debt. to issue so large an amount as 5.ooo.ooo.ooof of additional Treasury bonds proved somewhat puzzling. until the very simple explanation of the operation was forthcoming. The issue was fore- shadowed as long ago as August 7th. when powers were taken to render it possible. Its raisoa d'etre lies in the fact that Treasury expenditure is spread normally over the whole year. whereas the bulk of the Budget revenue is collected only during the second half of it. This special issue is designed to meet requirements during the leaner months before taxation is collected. The new bonds bear interest (payable in advance) at rates varying from 3 per cent. to 5 per cent.. and are issued for periods ranging from one to twelve months. the minimum amount of each bond being ioo.ooof. The decree which appeared in the Journal Officiel this morning suspending the turnover tax recently imposed
			on French exports is gratefully welcomed by the trad- ing community. who have found this impost a severe handicap in foreign markets. particularly now that the necessity of bringing French selling prices to the level of those prevalent in other countries has been realised. The amount to be secured from this tax is estimated in the 1927 Budget at 46o.ooo.ooof. The suppression of this. special tax is the result of what appears to have been justifiable pressure brought to bear on the Government by the various trade associations. who had no great diffi- culty in showing that if the tax were maintained the country would risk losing both exports and the revenue from the tax. Antiques. pictures. and other works of art do not benefit from the decree. and will continue to- be subject. as before. to an ad valorem export tax of 12 per cent. Unemployment. due to the unsettled situation provoked by the substantial improvement in the exchange value of the franc. and the measures taken to right the financial position. continues to increase somewhat. but is not prov- ing as serious as was feared would be the case. Reliable figures are difficult to obtain. owing to overlapping statis- tics. According to data recorded down to December 30. 13.072 persons were in receipt of unemployment allowances. through the 49 local funds (out of a total of 267) which are in operation. The labour bureaux report that at the end of the week 20.-1-07 applications for employment re- mained unsatisfied. Unskilled labour is. as usual. most heavily affected. chiefly in connection with the metallurgi- cal. skin and leather. timber. clothing. and building trades. The Paris Christmas trade was seriously below the average. and substantial reductions of staffs occurred generally. Plans for the organisation of public works for the relief of unemployed unskilled labour are being elaborated by the Ministers for the Interior and for Public Works. but these are expected to be on quite a moderate scale. in view of the chronic shortage of labour in the agricultural districts. The first extracts from the 1926- census returns. which have just been published. disclose- that there are now well over two million foreign workers employed in France. consisting chiefly of Italians. Belgians. Spaniards. Poles. and Russians. A large num- ber of the Belgians have already. in view of the shortage of employment here. returned to their own country. and it is proposed. by a judicious manipulation of passport and permit arrangements connected with immigration. ta thin out other sections of the foreign population. Trade in general continues unusually slack. and there is every indication that no improvement can be expected for some time to come.

			GERMANY.-CABINET QUESTION-BUDGET FOR 1927- 28-ox20140-CREDIToox20140-FOREIGN PAYMENT BALANCE- INDUSTRY-ox2014 NOVEMBER FOREIGN TRADE-ox2014 BOURSE.
			(FROM OUR correspondent.) BERLIN. January 5. THE formation of a Cabinet will be taken in hand next week.. The alternatives seem to be a Cabinet of the middle parties. with the same party composition as the last. and a Great Coalition Cabinet with representatives of the People's party. Centre. German-Democrats. and Socialists. The Socialists appear to be more inclined to enter a Great Coalition Cabinet than they were when the Marx Cabinet resigned. There is some talk of forming an electoral-o -bloc-o of the People's party. Centre. and Democrats. the three parties to maintain their independ- ence. but to render one another support. The President of the Republic is expected next week to invite the present Minister of Industry. Dr Curtius. or. if he fails. Dr Marx or the Centre politician Herr Stegerwald. to form a Cabinet. Dr Curtius is in close association with Dr Stresemann. and this would be an advantage in view of the present connection of international politics with econo- mical questions but the predominantly People's party colouring which would thereby be given to the Cabinet might be objected to by the two other middle parties. The Budget for 1927-2S goes to the Reichstag in two- forms. the Cabinet's original version and a version materially amended by the Reichsrat against strong pro- tests from the Finance Ministry. In order to provide for I
			its increases of certain expenditure. by altogether 127A million marks. the Reichsrat summarily. and it seems fictitiously. increased the Ministry's estimates of the yield of sales. traffic. tobacco. and other taxes. and also of Customs. to a total of 104 million marks. The remainder of the new deficit is got rid of by reducing certain expendi- ture items by altogether 231 million marks. The main increase in expenditure is caused by the Reichsrat's insistence on maintaining the Federal guarantee of a minimum total for the subventions to local finances out of the sales tax yield. The sum here involved is 112J Iriillion marks. The Budget was drafted on the assump- tion that this guarantee would be withdrawn. The Finance Minister denies in principle the right of the Reichsrat. as representing the States. to increase his esti- mates of revenue from particular sources. and points out that his estimates already represented the maxima and allowed for no margin against possible deterioration of trade. The dispute will be settled by the Reichstag. The new Budget. as originally submitted. balances at 8i milliard marks. It is. therefore. practically the same as that of 1926-27 as increased by the supplementary Budget. which has just been passed by the Reichsrat. This total is 8.6 milliard marks. estimated (Budget of 1925-26. 8.006 million marks 1924-25. 8.112 million marks). The ordinary Budget. as submitted. shows expenditure of 7.9 milliard marks. and is entirely covered by revenue. Ordinary revenue consists of-

			The ordinary expenditure contains 200 million marks unemployed support. 50 million marks for productive un- employment relief. and igg.8 million marks subsidies to the invalidity funds. The profit on coinage is 100 million marks lower than in 1926-27. and this source will fall out of the 1928-29 Budget entirely. owing to the token money circulation having reached its maximum of 20 marks per cap. The Extraordinary Budget shows revenue of 8.100.000 marks and expenditure of 509.5 million marks. leaving 501.4 million marks to be raised by loan. This estimated loan need is to be raised by certain expenditure increases mentioned during the debate. and by reinsertion of proposed expenditure on canal construction. to 528.4 million marks. Including loans sanctioned since last year. the total sum to be raised will be about 1.600 million marks. In the extraordinary expenditure appear considerable sums for social pur- poses. including 130 million marks for providing work for unemployed. 50 million marks for home colonisation. i 84 million marks for furthering internal navigation. and i 30 million marks further loans to the Railways Corpora- i tion for financing construction already begun.

			The money market was severely strained at the end of the year. Day money rose for a short time to 10 per cent. Although it had declined by yesterday to sh7h per cent.. apprehensions of a new tightening prevailed. and were the part cause of a sharp drop in stock quota- tions yesterday. The two private discounts are now at the- same rate. 4-k per cent. A reduction of the Reichsbank discount rate in January was confidently counted on. but the condition of the money market since November hardly seems to favour it. The belief is growing that the big rises. in the price of short-term credit before all recent settle- ment days have been due largely to the revival of business. activity. and that the conditions of mid-i926. when money was offered at nominal rates. will not return. The banks. are. nevertheless. again considering alleviations of their credit conditions. The Russian Trade Mission reports. that orders of a value of 150 million marks have so far been given under the scheme for a total export credit to Russia of 3oo million marks. The year-end report of the Reichs-Kredit A.G. estimates the foreign payment-balance- total of 1926 at I2j milliard marks. as against 13J mil- liard marks in-1925.. The payment balance. not counts ing short-term debt liabilities. was only 720 million marks passive. as against about 4.000 million marks (mainly the result of the import surplus) in 1925- and as the import of capital in the form of loans was 1.700 million marks. it is assumed that about 1.000 millions was spent on meeting short-term debts. The payment-balance of 1913 is estimated to have been active by 1.000 million marks. with a present value of 1.400 million marks. The accumulation of new capital in 1926 is estimated at 6.300 0 million marks. Home capital issues of all kinds in 1926 are estimated at 4.306 million marks. against 1.497 mil- lion marks in 1925 and 3.695 million marks average in 1907-12. The report estimates Germany's present annual need of new capital investments at 8 milliard marks gross. or 1.700 millions less than the supply provided by home creation of capital but this does not take into- account the Reparations drain abroad. The industrial outlook is favourable. The Prussian Trade Ministrv's report for January 1st is optimistic. The number of publicly supported unemployed on December 1st was 1.369.014. as against 1.316.143 on November i5th. This increase seems to be mainlv seasonal. as the lead- ing industries continue to report improvement. Bank- ruptcies in 1926 totalled 11.761. against 10.813 in 1925. a low figure of 253 in 1923. and 7.739 in 1914. The wave of bankruptcies seems to be at an end the fourth quarter of 1926 produced only 1.356. as against 5.643 in the first quarter. The coal market con- tinues active. The Ruhr daily average output has now for ten successive weeks exceeded 400.000 metric tons. as against between 306.000 and 330.000 tons in the weeks preceding the British strike. The iron and steel syndicates have retained unchanged for January their prices and selling conditions. and the Steel Syndicate-
			ration of output to 80 per cent. of capacity also remains in force. Foreign trade in November was (in marks. ooo's omitted)

			The import values are considerably increased by the recent rise in freight rates. The imports of foodstuffs and ot raw and half-finished materials were much larger in November than in the same month of 1925. Exports of .manufactured goods slightly declined as compared with October. The last days of 1926 witnessed a new sharp upward movement on the Bourse. and most indexes show quota- tions of December 31st as higher than before the Novem- ber reacion. The Frankfurter Zeitung's figure is 137.87. as against 58.31 on January 2. Iq26 (100 on January 2. 1925). Of 872 stocks dealt in in Berlin. 475 are quoted over par at the end of the year. and 256 between 100 and 150. Fifty-six are quoted over 200.

			(from OUR CORRESPONDENT.) Turin. December 31. 1926. THE attention of financial circles is again almost exclu- sively focussed on the Stock Exchange situation. Closing I settlement prices of representative variable dividend securi- ties were as follows -

			Since the last settlement day (December 24th) the market has gone from bad to worse. Bank of Italy touched bottom at 1.700. Banca Commerciale touched the 900 lire mark. Fiat went down to 275. and so on. From time to time short-lived recoveries take place. but they were almost always checked by a deluge of selling orders. At the present level of prices there is on the market quite a number of good first-rate securities-big banks. electricity. motor-car. land and house property-o -whose yields range from 6 to 10 per cent. and more. There is much specula- tion abroad as to the causes and probable outcome of the downward tendency. Some people point to the high rates of interest. from 8 to 9 per cent.. which have to be paid for carrying over speculative accounts in the bourses. Clearly people get tired of paying such rates. with the results of throwing good money after bad. But in its turn. why are such interest rates current The-revaluation or stabilisation theory. which is the most obvious reply. is a general theory. whose meaning is different from country to country. and from time to time. That in Italy. as in France. there is a revaluation crisis seems certain- but the features of it are not the same as. for instance. in Germany or Great Britain. Huge figures of unem- ployment are. for instance. lacking. The average monthly number of insured workers receiving unemployment pay
			was only 34.413 in October. as compared with 24.221 in January. 1926. Of course. these figures refer only to the unemployed who are entitled to receive grants from the National Institute for Social Insurance. and. there- fore. the total actual number of unemployed is higher. Statistics of this institute gives the total number at 79.678 as a minimum for July. and 156.139 as a maximum for January. 1926. with 148.821 for November. It does not seem probable that unemployment. although higher than in 1925. is going to be in Italy a great social problem as in other industrial countries. We are a predominantly agricultural country- many industries are located in agri- cultural regions- workmen or their relatives have con- nections with land. and derive aid from land-owning- or land-tilling. Moreover. notwithstanding the rapid in- crease of population. there is a dearth of man-power in agriculture. so that land may act as a safety-valve against excessive unemployment distress in the cities. The external trade figures do not as yet bear traces of that reduction in exports which had been prophesied as a consequence of the revaluation of the lira. and the dis- appearance of the premium on export-

			The interesting feature of the table. after the great in- crease in the post-war period. when the lira was devaluat- ing (from 1918 to 1922). is that in the years from 1922 to 1925 the absolute rate of increase was in each year almost exactly double that in the preceding year. In 1925 there was a frenzy of new issues-8 billions against 4.7 in 192 In 1926 the process is reversed in the first eleven months of 1926 the increase of capital is only 3.496.4 millions against 8.017.1 millions in the whole of 1925. The decrease is due partly to the Treasury restric- tions. as now each new issue has to be sanctioned bv the Treasury. but is also the consequence of the difficulty of finding a market for the new securities. Banks. holding companies. capitalists. and operators were kept busy during the last nine months of 1925. and the whole of 1926 in writing down valuations of securities. according- to the declining levels of stock exchange quotations. and it is probable that new savings of the middle and upper classes were absorbed bv such writing down. Figures for banking deposits. therefore. do not bear evidence of in- creases comparable to these recorded up to the end of 1924 (in millions of lire) -

			From the slowness of the increase in the savings figures I in 1925 and 1926 we must not draw the conclusion that I
			Italians do not save. In addition to the big sum devoted. as mentioned above. to writing down valuations of securi- ties (Baclii's general index of variable dividend securi- ties went down from 163-4 at December. 1924. to 111.3 at November. 1926). big sums were invested in buildings (town and country) and in agricultural improvements. Landowners and farmers all over Italy are investing their savings in agricultural machinery. reconstructing old- fashioned farm buildings. irrigation. reclaiming of waste lands. 0c. There is. also. much more caution displayed than in the last months of 1924 and the first of 1925. In those times big banking overdrafts were usual. and banks encouraged their customers to avail themselves liberally of the facilities afforded by them to industry and com- merce. but after March. 1925. the general policy of the banks became quite different month after month banks were insisting on the reduction of overdrafts. The banks situation is. therefore. more liquid. From a study of the balance-sheets of 50 banks it appears that the cash at hand increased between December 31. 1924. and October 31. 1926. from 1.679 to 2.207 millions lire. The propor- tion of the capital to total liabilities was also stronger- 2.441 against 29.666 millions at December 31. 1924. and 3.540 against 34.074 millions at October 31. 1926. An- other index of the increased liquidity of the banks is the big increase of the banks of issue deposits. Whereas.. as seen above. the ordinary bank deposits increased very slowly. the deposits of the banks of issue increased from 1.191.2 millions at the end of 1924. and 1.001.3 at the end of 1925. to 2.034.0 millions at November 30. 1926. As the Bank of Italy is the banks bank. it appears thaL commercial banks are aiming at keeping their position more liquid and stronger. Italy is indeed passing through a difficult adaptation to a new level of prices and. as usual. some suffering is the inevitable accompaniment of the revaluation of the lira. But the final outcome of the process seems to be the elimination of the unfit. more liquidity in the banks. lower. and. therefore. saner valua- tions in the balance-sheets- more prudent ideas of future profits. and a consequent check on expenditure. Perhaps prudence will continue to give counsels of restraint in the coming months. but prudence and restraint were always in difficult times the best roads towards recovery and future prosperity.

			- (FROM OUR correspondent.) WARSAW. December 18. THE Diet is now discussing the Budget estimates for the new financial year. Revenue is estimated at 1.899.253 million zlotys. and expenditure at 1.898.680 millions. so that a slight surplus is expected. Below is given a com- parison of the estimated revenue for 1927-28. with the actual revenue of the three previous years (million zlotys)- -

			The estimated revenue for 1927-28 is 160 millions higher than the actual revenue in 1925 and 1926. In taking into consideration the fact that since 1925 the zloty has lost nearly 50 per cent. of its value. we arrive at the conclusion that the budget estimates do not involve a burden which is beyond the capacity of the Polish tax- payer. Doubts are. however. expressed as to whether the yield-of-the capital levy is not estimated too high. The figure for 1927-28 is put at 95 million zlotys. as compared
			with 59.5 millions in 1925 and 52.8 millions in 1926. The estimated revenue from monopolies amounts to 595.5 mil- lion zlotvs. In comparison with 1926. this item increased by 48.2 millions. and in comparison with 1925 by 195.2 mil- lions. Monopolies are becoming more and more the pivot of Poland's financial system. The great increase of revenue from this source is mainly due to the intro- duction of the alcohol monopoly in 1925. Dr Kemmerer's report dwelt on the necessity of a more even distribution of the financial burden by a development of other taxes. As may be seen from the Budget estimates for 1927-28. the Government. did not follow this advice. The role of monopolies in the Budget has not only been maintained. but even strengthened. The expenditure is distributed among the most im- portant departments as follows (million zlotys) -
			Actual Expenditure. Estimates. 1925. 1926. 1927-28. Ministry of War.......... 675R 583R 623-2 Ministry of Education.... 309-1 2730 29516 Ministry of the Interior-.. 199-3 166-3 180-0 Public debts-............ 41-3 1300 145-1 Pensious. 0c............. 106-2 104-5 101-5 Ministry of Finance...... 1325 88-0 1005 Ministry-of Justice 84-0 77-9-.... 903 Ministry of Public Works.. 71-0 80-4 85-3 Ministry of Labour-...... 51-1 909 563
			The total expenditure for 1927-28 is estimated at 1.898.7 million zlotys. as compared with 1.771.2 in 1926 and 1.877.1 in 1925. The expenditure in most departments of the State is smaller in the estimates than in 1925. The trade returns for October show a further decline in the excess of exports over imports. as may be seen from the figures below (millions of gold francs) -
			Excess-of-. Imports. Exports. Exports. July-................... 65-8 120-7 54-9 lugust-.................. 921 128-5 36-4 September................ 85-9 11417 28-8 October-.................. 102-2 117-9 15-8
			The trade balance is becoming every month less favour- able. The excess of exports declined from 54.9 million gold francs in July to 15.8 millions in October. This is due in the first instance to increased imports. The ex- ports have been less irregular. In October imports were 36.4 millions higher than in July. The bad harvest has necessitated the import of foreign food. This. however. is not the only cause of the changes in the trade balance. Greater activity of Polish industry entails greater imports of raw materials. So. for instance. imports of wool increased from 6.7 million paper zlotys in July to 15.6 millions in October. and that of cotton from 19.9 to 31.5 millions during the same period. The changed state of the trade balance did not affect the rese-ve of foreign currencies held by the Polish Bank. During recent months this reserve has been steadily growing. From 78.5 millions gold zlotys at the-end of July. it rose to 113.5 millions at the end of October and to 137.5 millions at the end of November. During the first ten days of December a further increase has taken place. Together with gold 136.1 the reserve of the Bank Polski now amounts to 281.2 million gold francs. The ratio of the reserve as compared with the circulation surpasses 45 per cent.- if expressed in paper zlotvs. 80 per cent. The situation of the Joint Stock Bank has improved. Following a period of stagnation which lasted nearly at year after July. 1925. the second half of the present year has seen a small but steady increase of deposits. as may be seen from the figures below (in million zlotys) for 14 most important banks -
			Time Demand Deposits. Deposits. End ofJuIy.l9M................ 46-6 66-6 - December. 1925-.......... 30-7 37-3 June.-1926-............... 39-3 43-6 August. 1926.............. 4313 56-3 September.1926 45-3 59-9
			A similar upward tendency in the deposits of Saving Banks may be observed. The total amount of savings.1 however. is still very small. It does not surpass 76 million zlotys. a sum which. in comparison with pre-war savings. is quite insignificant. The returns of the saving banks show that the process of accumulation of new1 capital is still in its infancy.

			HONGKONG.ox2014 THE CHINESE POSITION-ox2014 TRADE MATTERS-BOXER COMMITTEE REPORToox2014 EXTRA-TERRITORIALITY.
			(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) HONGKONG. December 3. THE deep concern being manifested at home as to the situation in Hankow and Shanghai is in striking contrast to the indifference of a year and a half ago. when Hong- kong was in a similar plight. It is. however. all to the I good that attention is being focussed on this quarter of the globe. even if minor incidents are unduly magnified. The problem of China is likely to baffle. the world for many years to come. and no real solution will be found until public opinion in Britain and America has a more profound knowledge of China and the Chinese than it has at present. Public opinion in both countries is certainly being educated on the subject. and one gathers from periodical literature that there is nothing like the same amount of ignorance that there was a short time ago. There is. perhaps. still too much respect paid to the aspirations of Westernised Chinese. and a want of proportion in classing the Treaty-Port foreigners as -Diehards.o and adherents of the Kuomingtang as saviours of the country. But there is no longer a ten- dency to back any particular general. for it is now realised that the curse of China is the militarist Tuchun. and that so long as that curse remains no stability of authority can be looked for. The shifting of the centre of interest from the south to the Yangtsze has brought a certain amount of relief to this colony. The Nationalist Government has been transferred to Wuchang. and for the time being Canton has ceased to be a centre of political turmoil. and is resuming its natural role as the commercial metropolis of South China. Labour troubles are still a widespread x03030evil. and are aggravated by the constant multiplication x03030of trade unions. but with the Agitators Corps-o en- gaged elsewhere there does not seem to be the same x22C50co-ordination of effort in forcing concessions from em- ployers. In many directions trade is going on compara- tively smoothly and the restoration of shipping facilities has been the principal factor. Most of the river steamers are once more in full commission. and the only notable exception are the vessels owned by the British Com- pany. which make daily journeys to Canton with pas- sengers. but are prevented from loading or discharging -cargo. The ban on this company is due to a dispute with the Seamen's Union. which demands the dismissal of the present crews. who were taken on after the boycott x03030commenced in June. 1921. Negotiations for a settle- ment are going on. and it is expected that in the usual Chinese fashion a face-saving compromise will be Teached. So far as trade in Canton is concerned. the renewed boycott movement does not seem to have made much headway. as retailers are not disposed to give any -assistance to the Strike Committee in their efforts to stop the sale of British goods. It is clear that once merchandise is landed. little can be done to prevent it from going into consumption. and so long as there is no embargo on shipping. Hongkong will continue to supply the markets of Kwantung. Pirates and bandits and the exigencies of civil war hamper and obstruct the flow of trade. but there is always some channel open. even if it is a devious one. The past month has seen a steady expansion-of busi- ness. and stocks here have been considerably reduced. There has been a growing inquiry for replacement pur- poses. but the fall in exchange has made negotiation difficult. and little business has been brought to book. In the piece-goods market there has been some demand for fancy cottons for quick shipment. and a hundred or two cases of brocades have been booked to supplement indents placed in June last for December-February ship- ment. The fact that dealers have consented to pay nearly 10 per cent. more for their additional require- ments is an encouraging sign. as it shows confidence in the market being able to absorb the quantity arriving after the turn of the year. In the normal course of events the buving season for woollens would now be in full swing. Clearances of stocks. old and new. have
			been extremely good during the past six weeks but. so far. there has been little inquiry for new business. Brad- ford prices remain firm. and the parity in local currency is so far above last year's prices that dealers are expected to postpone purchasing as long as possible in the hopes of a rise in exchange. Within the past ten days the reports of the Boxer Indemnity Advisory Committee and the Extra-terri- toriality Commission have been issued. but at the present juncture little more than academic interest has been aroused. The proposal of the Boxer Committee to apply large funds to railway development without waiting for the establishment of an authoritative Central Government appears fantastic. The existing 7.000 miles of railway are almost entirely subject to the abuse of military com- manders and are fast going to wrack and ruin. What good purpose can be served by the creation of further means of transporting armies is beyond the comprehen- sion of the foreigner. As for the Extra-territoriality question. the evidence collected by the Commission should be sufficient to show that justice outside the foreign con- cessions is non-existent. We hear much of China's sovereign rights. but little of its duties towards its own people. The piracy of the s.s. Sunning within 100 miles of Hongkong is noteworthy in a long list of similar out- rages because it is the first case of a ship having been recaptured by its officers after control has passed into the hands of pirates. The full account of the affair reads like thrilling fiction-unarmed officers knocking out pirates with ships leads successful defence of the bridge with two revolvers and little ammunition retaliation on the part of the pirates by setting fire to the ship- the pirates offer to extinguish the flames if the officers would sur- render. and so on. Ultimately. British warships came to the rescue. and although a number of pirates got away and others were burned to death on the ship. a score were captured and brought to Hongkong for trial. As a result of the courageous resistance put up in this British vessel the pirates may for a time confine their attention to Chinese ships. which are a constant prey. But these waters mill never be free so long as the pirates retain their lair at Bias Bay. and it is astonishing to find that the Canton Government. which calls itself a Nationalist Government. allows so grave a menace to exist within the bounds of its principal province.

			Letters to the Editor.
			I OWNERSHIP OF BRITISH INDUSTRIAL SHARES.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST. Sir.-o -With reference to the series of articles appearing in your issues of December 18 and 25. 1926. and January 1. 1927. on the subject of -The Ownership of British Industrial Capital.o a rather peculiar result is obtained in the table on page 12 of the issue of January 1. 1927. as compared with the other tables published in the series. The table showing the geographical distribution-large hold- ings-gives. for-Courtaulds. I per cent. as being capital in large holdings in the hands of residents in the United States of America. while the table showing large shareholdings gives 28.4 per cent. and 26.2 per cent. of the preference and ordinary capital respectively-of the same firm as being in large hold- ings. On the basis of these figures. the proportion of capital held by residents in the United States of America must be nearly 3-per cent.. whereas the table (on page 12) of geo- graphical distribution-all holdings-gives nil. While it is appreciated that difierence in the method of pro- ducing the various tables would account for certain dis- crepancies. this one is sufficiently considerable to suggest either i an error or that the method of compilation is inadequate. The I latter is possibly the explanation. and this example adds weight to your plea for more information to be provided officially.-o -Yours faithfully. G. WARNER. 199 Pittshanger lane. Ealing. January 4th. 1927. lThe point to which Mr Warner draws attention reflects one of the inherent difficulties of the method of sampling-viz.. that results are likely to be much more accurate as regards the middle than the extreme positions. If. for instance. a sample of one in 100 is taken from a list which includes a single holding of -1.000.-000. the chances are 99 to I against that 1 holding's being included. It was precisely for this reason that we made a second series of observations comprising every
			large holding. The table showing -Geographical distribu- tion-large holdings -is explicitly stated to have been intro- duced in view of the possibility that certain large foreign shareholdings might have been omitted from the sample.o The American capital of Courtaulds. to which reference is made. is in the ownership of three large shareholders. who escaped enumeration under the first method. but were drawn in under the second. A similar remark applies as regards Brunner Mond and. possibly. Cairn Line. but the table shows that the figures for the eighteen companies. taken as a whnle. x22C50do not differ very seriously in the two tables. and the weighted averages support our conclusion that from go to 95 per cent. of the industrial capital appears to be British-owned.-o -Ed.

			CURRENCY POLICY.
			TO TIIE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST. Sir.-o -Mr Robert Graham. in your issue of the 1st inst.. writes with reference to the restoration of the gold standard. and describes it as a course taken to shorten the monetary yardstick. It was nothing of the sort. On the contrary. it was a course taken to restore the monetary yardstick. If Mr r Graham will study the Act under which the Treasury notes were issued. he will find that the holder of the notes was given the right to demand a gold coin of certain weight and fineness in exchangc for his note at the Bank of England during busi- ness hours. That right was rendered valueless by the subse- quent prohibition to export gold. There was an over-issue of notes. with the result that they then became depreciated. and I know of no other course than that of-gradual contrac- tion to again make them equal in value to the gold which they represented. That has now been done so far as gold bullion is concerned. and provided we get economy in administration I and a revival of trade. I believe our national credit will im- I prove. We will then see a fall in the rate of interest. and I I have no doubt of our ability to pay our interest charges on the debt. It is true that during this adjusting period we have had a considerable amount of distress and unemployment. That un- fortunately is the price we have to pay for the follies and bad finance of the war.-I am. Sir. your obedient servant.

			VIENNA MUNICIPAL FINANCE.
			TO THE EDITOR OF THE ECONOMIST. Sir.-o -The Austrian report published in your last issue gives an entirely false idea of the situation. especially concerning the Municipal Council of Vienna and its fiscal policy. The particularly difficult position of some Austrian industries and trades is due to many reasono-for instance. the need of foreign markets. high duty barriers. high rate of interest. and last but not least.-heavy taxation. both on the part of the Government and of the Municipal Council. I suppose that many of your readers will agree with me in considering the different methods of using the taxpayers money. The Government is obliged to issue Treasury bonds and tax the whole population in order to recover funds lost by the State Post Savings Bank and Centralbank in their different engagements with stock-jobbers. The taxpayers are obliged to refund some .o 5.-500.-000-o -the exact total amount of losses resulting from private speculations in French francs and in shares on the Viennese Stock Exchange. whereas the Municipal Council provides for 50.000 lodging accommoda- tions.-builds an underground railway Stadtbahn many water- power works. improves substantially the lighting of the streets. the roads. the machinery of the electric. tramway and gas undertakings. builds many public baths. hospitals. orphan asylums. 0c.. giving thus employment to hundreds of thou- sands of workmen of different kinds. The Viennese popula- tion enjoys the cheapest price of gas. electricity and some other commodities. delivered by the Municipal undertakings. as a result of business methods. well adopted by the Municipal Council. whose fiscal policy is to be described by your corre- spondent as a continuation of this demagogic social pro- gramme. In fact. there is a great difference in the use of public money here the restitution of private speculative losses by the taxpayers money. there an investment in public utility companies. managed by the Municipal Council. giving high returns to every taxpayer in form of cheap prices. The most striking and even convincing example of the-above statements is that fact that the Viennese -man in the street has an entire confidence in the financial abilitv of the Muni- cipal Council led by the Social Democrats. The exact amount of savings in the Municipal Savings Bank was on December 1st A.-S.-203.000.000. This institution therefore holds the first place among the Austrian Savings Banks. The second place is taken by the famous Credit Anstalt with over A.S. 100.000.000. the third by the First Austrian Savings Bank with some A.S.-98.-000.-000. I thank you very much for your kindness. and remain. yours truly. Franz HORNER. I Wachtergassel. Vienna. December 20th. 1926.

			RUSSIAN AGRICULTURE.
			No vaster field for the destructive forces of revolution could have been found than Russian agriculture. Here was an area of some 500.000.000 acres. providing means of livelihood for over a hundred million human beings. and nowhere else in the world. save. perhaps. China. could ruin and desolation have been wrought on such a tremendous scale-the mass production of misery. The irony of the whole wretched business is that the revolu- tion was launched on behalf of the workers and peasants. especially the latter. to whom were given the millions of acres of land taken from the nobility yet. despite this additional land. the misery of the peasants became greater than ever. The elabourate work under review has been written by a Russian lady scientist who has specialised in agricul- tural studies of her native land. It is based on personal knowledge. supported by a formidable array of recent authoritative work by Russian authors. a fairly extensive bibliography being appended. and it provides a detailed account of agriculture in Russia both before and after the revolution. It is a picture of dreadful gloom. at which Dante himself would have shuddered. The great business of agriculture. the mainstay. the sole mainstay of Russia. has been on the verge of collapse- millions have been starved- the terrible famines which periodically afflict the country have been intensified tenfold- hundreds of thousands have emigrated tc Siberia. fleeing in panic from their homes. and have found there a worse fate than if they had remained in Russia and the mighty structure of co-operation which was such a tower of strength to pre-war Russian agriculture has been nearly destroyed. There has been an agricultural crisis in Russia for more than fifty years. but the wheel of modern progress. which had been slowly moving here and there before the war. has during the past few years been ruthlessly turned backward. Things have improved somewhat the last year or two. perhaps-for the present work is not quite so up to date as one-would have expected. and gives few details later than 1922 or 1923-o -and a good harvest was expected this year 1926 The great flood of Soviet legislation and interference has ceased or abated- the peasant is more independent. and. at the same time. co- operation is resuming its sway. Russian agriculture ought to be great and flourishing. for it has several unique features which should make for strength. Apart from. or possibly related to. co-operation. there is the village community or mir.o together with a great de- velopment of village and cottage industries which had such enthusiastic support from Kropotkin. and which ought to be a source of stability and prosperity to agricul- ture in. any country. Much of the soil. too. is fertile. although vast capital expenditure is required for drain- age. artificial manures. and irrigation in parts subject to drought. There are also extensive forests which should and do form a powerful auxiliary to agriculture. Slowly and painfully. but yet surely. it is to be hoped. Russian agriculture is emerging from the dark morass in which it has been nearly engulfed. And there is one important development which finds little or no mention in Dr Kretschmann's book. namely. the great extension of oilseed cultivation. especially sunflower. It is ex- pected that by 1930 the area under oilseed crops (sun- flower. hemp. and flax) will be 16.250.000 acres. and the yield somewhere near 3.600.000 tons of seed. Already in 1925 the area was 12.600.000 acres. Several large oilmills are being erected to deal with this increased pro- duction. and even making large allowances for Soviet optimism. developments in this direction are bound to come. The author does. it is true. make brief reference to oilseed crops. but appears to regard them as inferior to cereals. This surely is a misapprehension. -La Questione Agraria in Russia Prima e Dopo la Rivoluzione.o Dott. Jenny Griziotti Kretschmann. Piacenza. Federazione Ital. dei Consorzi Agrari. 1926.

			POLITICAL SCIENCE.
			IN a recent book. Free Thought in the Social Sciences.o Mr J. A. Hobson subjected these sciences to a critical analysis. This book. though written from a very differ- ent angle. seems to have been prompted by a similar impulse. It is an attempt to answer the question whether there can be a genuine-o science of politics. and what the nature and method must be. The field of political science is constantly invaded. The economist. the psy- chologist. the anthropologist. and the biologist all in turn stake out claims to part of it. and it seems at times as if little were left unappropriated. Mr Catlin deals with these claims and concedes a good deal to them. but maintains. nevertheless. that there remains a quantity of material for study which does not properly belong to other branches of study. and which is sufficient to justify the existence of a genuine political science.

			STOCK EXCHANGE NEWS.
			SETTLING DAYS.
			SETTLING DAYS. TICKET. I ACCOUNT. January n. I January 13.
			THE principal event of the financial week was the closing on Wednesday morning of the subscription lists for the new 4 per cent. Consolidated stock offered at 85. The lists could have remained open until Thursday evening. but it was generally expected that they would not run to the full time. owing to the manner in which applications. according to re- port. were flowing in. The effect of the prompt closure of the lists was to accelerate the rises in Funding. Conversion. and other British Government securities. Corporation stocks are also moving upwards. and Colonials are better. Home rail- way prior-charge stocks. becoming gradually absorbed. show a stiffening in their prices. In the Foreign Market the news from China brought about declines in the values of the country's bonds. Amongst the European issues the new Bulgarian scrip gave wav on reports of Communist disturbances in the country. This affected some of the other European issues. and the tendency has been dull. Peruvian Corporation ordinary fell back. on the assump- tion that if the reorganisation plan goes through the value of the ordinary stock must automatically drop. Paris has been a buyer of Turkish Unified. The home railway market made a brave attempt to improve. but the effort met with little support. and prices drooped towards the end of the week. though the Underground stocks maintained their levels. Argentine Rails have been good. a little profit-taking causing a reaction from the top as the preliminary contango-day drew near. Antofagasta has been a weak spot. on the nitrate outlook. Nitrate-producing shares are heavy. Rubber shares are rather better. upon favourable expecta- tions in regard to the outlook for the price of the product. The tea market remains very heavy. Amongst oil shares an advance in Shells followed a brisk rise in Trinidad Centrals. both upon dividend hopes. the market as a whole being firm. The British Controlled report served to strengthen the two classes of the company's shares. Courtaulds have been very active round about 5. and Dunlops. dividend expectations in regard to which are beginning to make themselves heard. rallied. after being somewhat depressed earlier in the week. The tobacco market is easier. owing to fears of an addi- tional tax being imposed upon tobacco in the next Budget. Hudson's Bays gave way on news of a forthcoming issue of new shares at 4.5. Sudan Plantations weakened as the holders. with nothing particular to go for in the near future. sold these in order to take a hand in other shares. The iron and steel market is somewhat erratic. Movements are small and wayward in tendency. Newspaper shares make a good showing. substantial rises being recorded. The ship- ping group is quiet. London banking shares have advanced on the dividend announcements. The insurance market also is better. in anticipation of the forthcoming distributions. While gas stocks have shown a harder tendency. electricity supply shares are very quiet. The English textile market is steady. prices being better on balance. while artificial silk shares. apart from Courtaulds. took on a halting disposition. Marconis have been unsettled. Cable stocks are-hard equip- ment shares strengthened. Ever Readys came into favour. A fair amount of business in brewery issues has had no marked influence over prices. Sub Nigels are a remarkably good spot amongst Kaffirs. where the market is strong generally. De Beers and dia- monds. after giving way. have rallied. and Chartered reached 30s-o -twice their nominal value. Brussels supported its favourite South African copper shares. The Malayan Tin .group suffered from news of floods due to a hurricane. which damaged the Pahang and certain other properties. West African and Cornish shares have rested. Barrier varieties eased off on Melbourne selling orders. Russians and Cana- dians aroused no interest.
			The Stock Exchange managers have-doubled the annual subscriptions to be charged after March 24th in certain cases for authorised and unauthorised clerks. The rule is not retro- spective. This will tend to increase the value of Stock Ex- change membership. and the price of House shares. 25 paid is better at 150 upwards.

Tufnell Campbell. in his address. said that the company was in a strong financial position. Reviewing the developments that had already been carried out in the con- cessions. he said that a steamship service on the River Paraguay. between Buenos Aires and Gaiba. had been successfully started. The construction of a port at Gaiba had been already carried out. and the Bolivian Government had formally handed over 6.000 acres in the vicinity for housing and works. The construc- tion of a railway from Gaiba to Corazon. some 60 miles. was. well in hand. The Chairman reported that active negotiations were in pro- gress with strong groups for the formation of subsidiary com- panies to deal with the vast oil. tin. cotton. gold. rubber. and timber resources within the 30.000.000 acres of the concessions. Oil.-It was now clear that the statements made by the Ameri- can engineer. David White. to the effect that Bolivia has the largest known resources of petroleum in the world. were sub- stantially correct. and the directors were going forward in great confidence with negotiations with very- important British oil groups who had expressed a desire for the opportunity of work- ing oil on the concessicns. Tin.-o -Negotiations with an important British group handling tin properties were far advanced Gold.-A contract had been entered into with a company formed for the purpose. called the Mines Equipment and Supply Associ- ation. Limited. for the working of gold. Cotton.-An experimental area near Gaiba had been planted with cotton. -There is no doubt.o said the Chairman. -that a vast revenue will be obtainable from cotton cultivation at an early date. especially in view of the fact that the Bolivian Govern- ment has granted an export bounty up to 2d per pound on cotton produced within the territories.o Rubber.-Considerable areas within the concessions were already producing rubber. With a view to developing these re- sources. the directors were in touch with substantial rubber growers. and hoped to report a favourable arrangement at an early date. The directors looked forward to the year 1927 with very great confidence. The exploration of the concessions. which cover an area about twice as big as the United Kingdom. would re- p quire many years of scrious application. but the company should be in a position to produce profits at a very early date. f

			LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION. LIMITED.
			NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING.
			The ninth annual ordinary general meeting of the members of Low Temperature Carbonisation. Limited. was held. on the 31st ultimo. at Winchester House. Old Broad street. London. Sir Arthur Wheeler. Bart.. D.L.. J.P. (chairman of the company). presiding. The Chairman said- Ladies and gentlemen.-This is the first occasion on which I have had the honour of addressing you as chairman of this company. which position I have accepted at the request of my colleagues. It is unnecessary for me here to refer to the history of the company and the events which led up to the reorganisation. It is sufficient to say that the finances have been entirely re- organised. and the new working capital provided by the issue of the prioi lien debenture stock. after deduction of expenses. pro- vides a net sum of about 135.000. subject to certain contingent claims which are in piocess of adjustment. Your company starts now with a clean slate. Recognising that the undertaking they have entered upon is of national importance. they realise that their first duty is to construct a plant capable of giving commercial results. The technical efficiency of the Parker process has been successfully proved under the tests of the Government Fuel Research Board. The old plant was not sufficiently large. and in the latter part of its operation developed defects for which improvements were devised. so it was decided to dismantle it and to erect a plant of sufficient capacity to give commercial results. We therefore decided to erect five batteries. one in reserve and four in work. totalling 160 retorts. with a combined carbonising capacity of 250 tons of coal per day. thus ensuring the continuous treatment of 200 tons daily. and this within a few months should prove whether in working practice the profits anticipated can be realised.
			THE NEW PLANT. The new plant has been carefully designed and standardised by our consulting engineers. along with Mr Charles Parker. so as to eliminate all weaknesses. Contracts have been placed with two eminent firms for the building. of the retorts. settings. and the requisite engineering outfit. The old batteries were entirely demolished. leaving stand- ing the subsidiary plant. consisting of boiler-house. gasometers. producer gas plant. extractors. cooling towers. 0c.. all of which are necessary for handling the by-products resulting from the process. The cost of dismantling the old plant has been entirely de- frayed out of the sale of the surplus materials. The total cost of the new works. includinf. erection. has been estimated at 75.000. -thus leaving a balance which we believe is ample for working capital. The coal strike has somewhat delayed our work. but the con- tractors have undertaken to deliver the whole of the plant in good working order by the end of May next. They are. in fact. under a penalty to deliver one battery of 32 retorts by the middle of March. This will be put into operation as soon as completed. and the company should be turning out between 4oo and 500 tons of coalite per week. with the other by-products. by the end of May. By May. therefore. ve hope to deliver the goods.
			Many alternatives have been suggested to us as substitutes for use in our domestic open grates. Gas fires and electric heating have their advocates others have urged the merits of anthracite coal and its value as a smokeless fuel. but there is nothing like coalite. I have tried it and proved its value. Englishmen will not readily forgo their cheerful open fires. to which they have been so long accustomed. and for which anthra- cite is. as you know. quite unsuitable. because it must be burnt in a closed stove whereas our product. while eliminating the smoke nuisance. which has stood so long condemned for the damage which it does to health and buildings and vegetation. causes no revolution in national habits. as it can be used exactly like raw coal. but without the attendant smoke and dirt. It burns quite as freely. with probably a greater amount of heat for its bulk. PBOFITS r'KOM BY-PRODUCTS. When the whole plant has been completed we feel no doubt that. apart from the continuous production of 1.000 tons per week of a perfect domestic fuel. the process will be able to show large profits from its production of fuel oil. motor spirit. sulphate of ammonia. and rich gas. which latter we anticipate will have an enormous influence upon the cost of the generation of electric power. As you are aware. the Government has just placed on the Statute Book an Electricity Act. which deals with the distribution of power. but makes no direct provision for its production. The commercial prosperity of this country depends largely upon cheap power. in which respect it lags far behind other industrial coun- tries. and there is no need for me to enlarge here upon .he im. portance of our process to the future of our country when I tell you that we calculate it-will effect an economy of one-fifth in the present fuel cost of power generation. That result alone should. if realised. be sufficient to compen- sate the shareholders who have for so many years retained their faith in the ultimate success of the company's process. As explained in the notice convening this meeting. the financial year of the company terminates on July 31. 1927. The accounts will then be made up. and. with the full report of the directors. will be issued to the shareholders early next autumn. I The formal business having been transacted. the proceedings terminated.

			Messrs Samuel Montagu and Co. wrote on January jth as follows - GOLD. During the week under review 228.000 on balance was received by the Bank. During the year 1926. according to the daily announcements by the Bank. there was a net influx
			of .6.-271.000. The net efflux since the resumption of an effective gold standard now stands at 5.096.000. SILVER. Delivery in time for the January Bombay settlement has been extended to consignments by this week's steamer. and prices have therefore been sustained by purchases for ship- ment. though in most cases limits were given and were from day to day reduced. Quotations consequently were disposed to ease. the movement being assisted by weakening China exchanges. accompanied by offerings of silver from that quarter. Uneasiness on account of affairs at Hankow appears to act as a bear factor. America has been disposed to sell. but the Continent has been. as usual of late. inactive. Though the appearance of the market is dull. the movement downward appears to be sluggish. United Kingdom imports and exports of silver during the week ended the 29th ultimo were -

			MISCELLANEOUS. BLUNDELL. SPENCE. AND COMPANY. LIMITED.-The directors deeply regret to report that Mr Wilmot Blomefield. O.B.E.. died on July 5th last. Mr Blomefield acted as a managing director in London since the year 1923. and the loss of his valuable services is a heavy one. The vacancy thus caused on the board was filled by the directors. who on July 6. 1926. appointed Mr Alic W7alter Ayling to be a director in Mr Blomefield's place until the next ordinary general meeting. The directors consider it desirable. however. to postpone the appointment of another managing direc- tor in London. The directors recommend a dividend at the rate of S per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares. calculated in accordance with the regulations of the company. less income-tax. payable in two instalments. half on February 4. 1927. and the remainder on August goth next. or on such later date as the board may determine. It is proposed to grant a sum of 1.000 to the Longstaff Pension Fund. and to place a sum of 1.500 (already provided in the accounts under review) to the credit of the dubious
			and bad debt account. There will remain the sum of .o 22.671 to be carried forward. The dubious and bad debt account will have standing to its credit 13.705. The gratuity fund will amount to .o 3.637- the investments of the Longstaff Pension Fund amount to .o 17.828. During the past year 10.514 has been spent on maintenance. repairs. and additions. Of this amount 9.014 has been charged to revenue. and the remaining 1.500 to the Hull and London premises account for additions to premises and plant. No charge has been made against the profits as pro- visions for depreciation. in view of the sums annually spent on repairs and renewals. HOULDER LINE. LIMITED.-o -The twenty-eighth annual report for 1926 shows that. after making provision for general maintenance. expenses. taxation. diiectors remuneration. audit fees. and divi- dends paid and accrued on preference share capital. there re- mains a credit balance of 134.117. An amount of 100.000 has been transferred to depreciation account (increasing that fund to 500.000). leaving a balance of 34.117 to which is added the amount brought forward from previous account-o -namely. 85.010 giving an available balance of 119.127. A dividend of 10 per cent. (tax free) is recommended on the ordinary shares of the company. which will absorb 27.500 leaving an amount to carry forward of 91.627. The whole of the company's vessels are in commission. and have been thoroughly well maintained. THE CUBAN AMERICAN SUGAR COMPANY.-The re-ort for the year ended September 30th last states that owing to restrictive measures adopted by the Cuban Government. the company's sugar production was only 307.569 tons. against 341.641 in the previous year. The net profit was $939.253. Regular quarterly dividends of $1 75 per share were paid on the preferred stock. and on the common stock three dividends of 50 cents and one of 25 cents.

			Commercial Reports.
			THE CORN TRADE.
			Mark Lane. Friday Evening. The recent spell of drier weather has enabled farmers to complete winter sowings and commence ploughing for the spring seed-bed. Winter wheat presents a healthy appearance. and on average the acreage is about on a par with last year. though in some parts the abnormally wet autumn seriously hampered seeding operations. Native wheat has been in moderate supply. but values were generally steady as no pressure arises to sell. The market pre- sented quiet features during the week. and imported descriptions tended easier in sympathy with forward weakness. In the floating and forward cargo section the small inquiry was mostly on Conti- nental account. and values responded to lower American and Argen- tine cables. while continued heavy shipments have resulted in a further increase in floating supplies. The new Argentine crop is now moving. consequently offers from this quarter are on a liberal scale. Australian growers. however. are reluctant to sell owing to declining values. while some scarcity of freight space is felt. especially for early loading. Steamers of West Australian loading sold 53s 71d to the Continent. about 16.000 tons Rosafe. 63 lbs. March arrival. at 5os to Portugal. and 5.000 tons Australian. January shipment 53s gd to Italy.

			AMERICAN WHEAT MARKETS. Fluctuating conditions have prevailed in the wheat markets this week. rallies occurring in the earlier part of the day being lost later on account of realising. A firmer tone was noticeable towards the end of the week. export inquiry being of fair dimen- sions. whilst cold weather and absence of snow covering in the winter wheat belt caused apprehension with regard to that crop.

			COAL.
			Our Cardiff correspcndent writes -Conditions continue very depressed. and there has been an all-round fall in prices. The wagon difficulty remains acute. and with little new business in the market collieries have experienced great difficulty in keeping at work. many having to suspend operations on one or two days during the week. The Egyptian State Railways have cancelled the recent tenders for 160.000 tons of coal. and are now inviting new tenders for the supply of 100.000 tons as from February 1st next. It is probable that the new tenders will offer appreciably lower prices. During the past fortnight quotations have declined to the extent of from 2s 6d to 3s per ton. and on Thursday the current market prices were as followso-o -Best Admiralties. 26s to 27s 6d seconds. 25S to 253 6d best drys. 25s to 265- Black Veins. 26s to 26s 6d Western Valleys. 26s to 26s 3d- Eastern Valleys. 25s to 26s best steam smalls. 15s to 16s ordinary cargo smalls. 14s to 14s 6d coking smalls. 15s 6d to 16s anthracite best large. 45s to 47s 6d Red Vein large. 32s 6d to 35s machine-made cobbles. 52s 6d to 55s rubbly culm. 16s to 17s coke for export. 6os to 65s patent fuel. 29s 6d to 32s 6d pitwood. ex ship. 27s 6d to 28s. Our Glasgow correspondent writeso-o -Work was resumed on Tuesday. but so far business has not expanded appreciably.

			IRON AND STEEL.
			We extract the following from the weekly report of the London Iron and Steel Exchangeo-o -The activity which ruled previous to 1 the holidays appears to have subsided somewhat. This. however. is i a normal feature of the market at this season. It is known. how- ever. that considerable contracts for steel material are pending. E which will be placed with British works. Many of the British steel works and blast furnaces have not yet restarted after the 1 coal strike. but it is possible that by the end of January the pro- duction of iron and steel in this country will be at a higher rate- than that immediately preceding the strike. So far. the British t steelworks appear to be concentrating upon the completion of old standing contracts. and as a consequence have maintained their prices. On the other hand. the Continental steelworks. which are now feeling the re-entry of the British makers into the market. have reduced their quotations by several shillings during the past week or two. Apparently. however. they are still finding difficulties in securing sufficient business to take the place of the old contracts now being worked off. Our Middlesbrough correspondent's report. dated January 6th. is as follows -Pig-iron- There has been a further increase in the number of furnaces operating. and as soon as coke supplies become plentiful at an economic figure still more will be started. Most of the iron made is for works own consumption. the supply for the open market being still insufficient. The price of Cleveland No. 3 is round 85s per ton for early delivery. but for forward contracts 82S 6d would be accepted. East Coast hematite is still scarce. but x0303 the output is being increased. and for forward deliveries gos per ton would be taken for mixed numbers. Manufactured Iron and Steel.-o -The local steel works are operating as far as fuel supplies permit. and all have good order books. Prices are unchanged. Steel ship plates. 8 17s 6d steel ship angles. 7 12s 6d iron bars. 0z 5s- steel rails. 8 ios. Iron Ore.-o -There has been no fresh business of any importance. and with big deliveries to be made under old contracts. the works will hold off as long as possible. Our Sheffield correspondent writes-The year has opened very quietly. Dear coke appears to be holding back developments. Blast furnace coke cannot be obtained below 20S per ton at ovens. and at this figure makers of pig-iron cannot quote less than Sss f.o.t.. which compares 70s before the dispute. The tonnage of pig-iron being produced is small. but consumers have refused to I-buy anything more than odd lots to cover very special orders for work. The Unitcl Steel Companies now have seven open- hearth steel furnaces in operation. as against five at the outbreak of the dispute. A continuous bar and strip rolling mill and a con- tinuous wire-rod rolling mill. each having a capacity of 1.500 tons per week. have also been restarted after seven months idle- ness. A number of file-making firms are busy on a Russian order for 30.000 dozen of these tools. and another order from the same market for 5o.coo large saws has just been shipped. Our Glasgow correspondent writeso-o -The holiday period has not been marked by any noteworthy occurrence in the iron and steel trades. It is confirmed that the Fairfield Shipbuilding Company is to undertake the construction of a cruiser for the British Government. and Messrs. Lobnitz have a contract for a x03030dredger for the Malay States. Of the steel works which made a start before the holiday. several have been working through- out the vacation. Order-books are sufficient to account for the total output of most works for a considerable time to come. The output of pig-iron is still far short of the demand. and it will be some weeks yet before a really useful number of furnaces are ready A large number of inquiries are in the market. Steel plate and bar prices remain firm at 8 7s 6d and 7 17s 6d respectively. Prices of Continental finished and semi-finished steel and iron have weakened. and considerable quantities are on offer. Malleable iron works are well employed. and have been steadily producing for some weeks. Sheet makers resumed work after a short holiday. and are experiencing an improving demand prices. however. are down to pre-strike level. For heavy gauges the Continent is becoming a serious competitor in the local markets. Our Cardiff correspondent writeso-o -In the tinplate industry business has been stagnant. and prices have receded to 2os basis 1-Imx. f.o.b.. for the second quarter of the current year. For prompt plates the price has been is 6d higher at 21s 6d. and for shipment during the next two months quotations have been round 21s per box. Owing to the Christmas holidays there was a decrease n
			the supplies received at the warehouses at the works. and shipments were also slightly lower. Foreign tinplate bars are ruling at 5 5s per ton. and Welsh tinplate bars are unchanged at 6 15s. Galvanized sheets have'been a quiet market at 16 5s to 16 10s per ton.

			THE COTTON TRADE.
			LIYERPOOL. January 6. 1927. Quotations show very little change. but markets have been much broader and some fairly large lines have changed hands in the futures market. Spinners have not yet secured their supply for the next few months. and a better inquiry for actual cotton is looked for. especially should prices show any sign of stiffening. Weather reports from cotton districts in America have been rather un- favourable. The final ginning figures may be much below the Government estimate. The following are spinners takings of the crop for the six months ended December 31st (in thousand bales) -
			1925- Igz6. America-............................. 4.052 4.351 Great Britain 912 731 Continent 2.01I 2.oy Various-.................................... 606-...... 772 Total 7.581 o.920

			Despite the comparatively poor showing of Great Britain. the world has taken one million bales more than during the same period last season. Spot sales for the week December 31st to January 6th were 29.000 bales. Of these. 18.650 were American. 700 Brazilian. 6.000 Peru. 1.250 Egyptian. 2.400 African. Imports for the same period were 88.607 bales. of which 72.809 were American. 212 Brazilian. 4.073 Peruvian. 10.466 Egyptian. 24 African. 036 East Indian. and 87 sundries.

The market has presented a more cheerful appearance. and in certain quarters a larger business has been done. The feature of interest has been the revival of cloth demand for India. and some substantial sales have taken place. especially for Calcutta in light fabrics. It is hoped that this activity will bring in buyers for other outlets. News from China has been rather worse. Not more than a miscellaneous business has been done for most of the minor markets. Inquiry in American yarns for home consumption has broadened. and the turnover. especially in medium numbers. shows an improvement. A steady business has passed in Egyptian spinnings.

			THE WOOL TRADE.
			Our Bradford correspondent. writing on Thursday. says- There is a more hopeful feeling. but this does not find expression in any definite increase in demand. Wool values remain firm. and there is a fairly general impression that prices are on a stable basis. This is largely due to continued buying on foreign account. but will doubtless have some effect on users in this country. Inquiry for piece goods shows a definite tendency to improve. and if this can be maintained topmakers and spinners must ultimately benefit. Wool and its products are held reasonably cheap at to-day's prices. A year ago 64s average tops were quoted at 4gd. while the quotation to-day is 44 d. The same quality of noils shows a reduction of iod on the year. while 2-48s yarn out of 64s tops is now quoted at 5s 4d. compared with 5s 7Jd. Values have been depressed to something approaching their true economic level. and if there is any call for textiles. then producers should be in a position to meet demand with some degree of certainty. and make a reasonable profit. There need be no expectation of a spectacular recovery. but rather a steady revival. provided nothing unforeseen upsets the political or financial world. COLONIAL WOOL. (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) The second half of the Australian selling season commenced on Monday with a sale at Sydney. and both private and public cables indicate that values were firm on the basis current before the Christmas recess. By the end of next week trade will be looking forward to the opening of the first series of London sales. during which about 100.000 bales are expected to be offered. This is a very reasonable quantity. but in view of the heavy direct arrivals which are now pouring into consuming centres both at home and abroad. it will no doubt be sufficient to satisfy those who are not disposed to operate in overseas markets. or who want wool on the spot. It is somewhat early to make any suggestions about values. but a healthy market may be expected. for a fair measure of confidence has already been shown in the future. The fact
			that values are firm in Australia is some justification of this attitude. and the selection being good. was no doubt another factory in encouraging competition. For the guidance of those operating in the colonies it may be pointed out that some of the best Australian wools become avail- able in January. New England clips should be obtainable in considerable quantities this month in Sydney. These always come on to the market rather later. and a keen demand from all sections may be expected on account of the very fine quality. It should not be expected that the wool will be any finer than last year. Indeed. it is possible that it will be somewhat coarser. for New England pastoralists have had such a season as is likely to bring about this result in the clip. Private reports from Sydney make reference to the deeper quality of many of the clips. but we think sufficient allowance is not made for the effect of weather condi- tions upon the growing fleece. A dry season produces hunger fineness. the staple showing les3 life and elasticity. but apart from this the Australian merino clip is now showing a marked falling off in quality. This is regrettable. particularly at such a time as the present. when fine quality spinning wools are in demand. This call is the result of the popularity of light weight dress fabrics made by Roubaix-Tourcoing manufacturers. An attempt is being made to produce dress goods weighing only 6 ozs to the yard. and for this purpose a big supply of verv fine merino wool is wanted. This is one reason why French spinners have bought such large quantities of the Cape clip. which is many counts finer and altogether better grown than a year ago. The wool market generally is sound. and at current values there is a reasonable prospect of a steady demand continuing.

			HIDE. LEATHER. AND ALLIED TRADES.
			I On the whole the domestic hide market remains firm. although best heavy ox hides are not very much in favour. At the sales held in Bermondsey on Thursday. best ox sold from 6Jd to -ox007Cod and seconds from 6Jd to yfd per lb. several selections making an id advance on last prices. Calfskins were steady at last prices. best selections selling at jyd to i2fd per lb. Woolskins made from 6d to us 3d. and hoggs from zs 5d to us qd each. Foreign hides are steady. but home tanners are not big buyers at the moment. Business in S.A. fregorifics has been done at gd. mostly in best Argentine ox with the United States. Prices for dry hides are maintained. and dry Americanos have changed hands at njd. Other classes are in good demand. and a fair amount of trading has been done in Capes and Brazils. The Chicago position is cabled as firm and strong. with best heavy packers selling freely at 155- cents. Business in sole leather has hardly got into its stride. Inquiries for light and medium bends have been frequent. however. In upper leathers sampling is going forward in coloured Continued on page 86.

			THE CUBAN-AMERICAN SUGAR CO.
			ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30. 1926.
			To the Stockholders December 14. 1926. The Board of Directors submits the following report for the fiscal year ending September 30. 1926- Owing to the restrictive measures adopted by the Cuban iGovernment on May 3. 1926. our sugar production was con- siderably reduced and a large quantity of our cane available for rinding was not harvested. The Company produced during the year from its six estates 307.569 short tons (2.000 lbs.) equivalent jto 1.922.310 bags (320 lbs. each) of raw sugar. as compared with 341.641 short tons equivalent to 2.135.259 bags for the previous year. A comparison of the output of raw and refined sugar for the past two years appears in the following-table-o

			The net profit of the Company for the fiscal year amounted to $939.253.71. The usual provisions have been made for depreci- 4tion of buildings. machinery and equipment. sufficient reserves have been set aside for all doubtful Colonos accounts. for all United States and Cuban Income Taxes. and for the year's pro- portion of cost of cane plantings. Raw sugar on hand at September 30th has been taken at prices subsequently realized. The capital outlay during the year was comparatively small. amounting to $524.721.42. which includes extensions of rail- pads to cane areas previously planted. machinery purchased to strengthen important factory units. and construction of addi- tional molasses storage tanks. buildings. etc. Adequate expenditures rvere also made for repairs and replacements to plant and
			facilities. in accordance with the Company's policy of maintaining its factories and equipment at the highest standard of efficiency. Regular quarterly dividends of $1.75 per share were paid on the preferred stock. and on the common stock three dividends of 50c and one dividend of 25c per share were paid. It was decided at the August Meeting of the Board. on account of the continued unsatisfactory condition of the sugar business. to reduce the common stock dividend to 25c per share. The Company purchased during the year $1.000.00 of the First Mortgage Collateral 8 per cent. Sinking Fund Gold Bonds due March 15. 1931. making a total of $185.000. of these bonds now in the Treasury. The Company has no bank indebtedness. and its only current liabilities are those accruing in connection with the daily routine of its business. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30. 1926. together with the Profit and Loss and Surplus Accounts for the year ended that date. have been audited and certified to by the Company's Auditors. Messrs Stagg. Mather Co.. and are ap- pended hereto. The Board wishes to express to the Officers and Employees its sincere appreciation of their loyal and efficient services rendered to the Company during the year. Respectfully submitted by order of the Board of Directors.

			Yresident. CERTIFICATE OF ACCOUNTANTS. December 13. 1926. To the President and Directors of The Cuban-American Sugar Company We have examined the books and accounts of The Cuban-American Sugar Company and its Subsidiary Companies for the year ended September 30. 1926. and hereby certify that the annexed Consolidated Balance Sheet has been correctly prepared therefrom. Investments in other Companies are carried at conservative values. Refined Sugars on Hand September 30. 1926. have been valued at cost which was lower than market. the stock of Raw Sugar at the net prices subsequently realized and the stock of Molasses at the minimum net price to be received. Subject to the foregoing and to the final determination of Federal Taxes. we certify that. in our opinion. the annexed Consolidated Balance Sheet sets forth the true financial position of the Companies as at September 30. 1926. and that the relative Profit and Loss and Surplus Accounts correctly show the results of the operations for the period.

			VEGETABLE OILS AND OILSEEDS.

Linseed oil is lower in sympathy with seed. but it has done very little to stimulate demand from consumers. who are moving very cautiously in con- sidering their season supplies. Current value is 30 10s per ton. naked. ex Hull mill. for prompt and January-April delivery. with business done in London below 30. Cotton oils have been firmer and in better demand. but at the close have become easier. crude Egyptian offering at 3 10s and technical refined at 35 prompt. Other oils are quiet and somewhat lower on the week. In the oilseed section there has been more interest in new crop Plate linseed. crushers having been in the market. For January- February and February-March shipment down to 14 5s has been accepted. but a rather steadier feeling has manifested itself. and ios to 10s above this figure is now asked. Seed on passage and for early shipment continues at a premium of 20s to 25s. A small business has been done in Calcutta linseed to London at x6 173 6d early January loading. Black Egyptian cottonseed has been done at S ys 6d for January shipment. but rather more is now demanded bv shippers. Soya beans to the Continent have changed hands at n 2s 6d December-January shipment.
