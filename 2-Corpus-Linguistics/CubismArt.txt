the second phase being called "high cubism", (from 1909 to 1914) during which time juan gris emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and finally cooper referred to "late cubism" (from 1914 to 1921) as the last phase of cubism as a radical avant-garde movement.[10] douglas cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of braque, picasso, gris (from 1911) and léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement.[4]pablo picasso, les demoiselles d'avignon, 1907, considered to be a major step towards the founding of the cubist movement[11]pablo picasso, 1909-10, figure dans un fauteuil (seated nude, femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, tate modern, londonproto-cubism: 1907-1908[edit]main article: proto-cubismcubism burgeoned between 1907 and 1911. pablo picasso's 1907 painting les demoiselles d'avignon has often been considered a proto-cubist work. georges braque's 1908 houses at l’estaque (and related works) prompted the critic louis vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). gertrude stein referred to landscapes made by picasso in 1909, such as reservoir at horta de ebro, as the first cubist paintings. the first organized group exhibition by cubists took place at the salon des indépendants in paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called 'salle 41'; it included works by jean metzinger, albert gleizes, fernand léger, robert delaunay and henri le fauconnier, yet no works by picasso or braque were exhibited.[4]by 1911 picasso was recognized as the inventor of cubism, while braque’s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the l’estaque landscapes. but "this view of cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called cubists," wrote the art historian christopher green: "marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the salon des indépendants in 1911 [...]"[4]the assertion that the cubist depiction of space, mass, time, and volume supports (rather than contradicts) the flatness of the canvas was made by daniel-henry kahnweiler as early as 1920,[12] but it was subject to criticism in the 1950s and 1960s, especially by clement greenberg.[13]contemporary views of cubism are complex, formed to some extent in response to the "salle 41" cubists, whose methods were too distinct from those of picasso and braque to be considered merely secondary to them. alternative interpretations of cubism have therefore developed. wider views of cubism include artists who were later associated with the "salle 41" artists, e.g., francis picabia; the brothers jacques villon, raymond duchamp-villon and marcel duchamp, who beginning in late 1911 formed the core of the section d'or (or the puteaux group); the sculptors alexander archipenko, joseph csaky and ossip zadkine as well as jacques lipchitz and henri laurens; and painters such as louis marcoussis, roger de la fresnaye, františek kupka, diego rivera, léopold survage, auguste herbin, andré lhote, gino severini (after 1916), maría blanchard (after 1916) and georges valmier (after 1918). more fundamentally, christopher green argues that douglas cooper's terms were "later undermined by interpretations of the work of picasso, braque, gris and léger that stress iconographic and ideological questions rather than methods of representation."[4]john berger identifies the essence of cubism with the mechanical diagram. "the metaphorical model of cubism is the diagram: the diagram being a visible symbolic representation of invisible processes, forces, structures. a diagram need not eschew certain aspects of appearance but these too will be treated as signs not as imitations or recreations."[14]high cubism: 1909-1914[edit]albert gleizes, l'homme au balcon, man on a balcony (portrait of dr. théo morinaud), 1912, oil on canvas, 195.6 x 114.9 cm (77 x 45 1/4 in.), philadelphia museum of art. completed the same year that albert gleizes co-authored the book du "cubisme" with jean metzinger. exhibited at salon d'automne, paris, 1912, armory show, new york, chicago, boston, 1913there was a distinct difference between kahnweiler’s cubists and the salon cubists. prior to 1914, picasso, braque, gris and léger (to a lesser extent) gained the support of a single committed art dealer in paris, daniel-henry kahnweiler, who guaranteed them an annual income for the exclusive right to buy their works. kahnweiler sold only to a small circle of connoisseurs. his support gave his artists the freedom to experiment in relative privacy. picasso worked in montmartre until 1912, while braque and gris remained there until after the first world war. léger was based in montparnasse.[4]in contrast, the salon cubists built their reputation primarily by exhibiting regularly at the salon d'automne and the salon des indépendants, both major non-academic salons in paris. they were inevitably more aware of public response and the need to communicate.[4] already in 1910 a group began to form which included metzinger, gleizes, delaunay and léger. they met regularly at henri le fauconnier's studio near the boulevard de montparnasse. these soirées often included writers such as guillaume apollinaire and andré salmon. together with other young artists, the group wanted to emphasise a research into form, in opposition to the neo-impressionist emphasis on color.[15]louis vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th salon des indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, léger and le fauconnier as "ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes."[16] at the 1910 salon d'automne, a few months later, metzinger exhibited his highly fractured nu à la cheminée (nude), which was subsequently reproduced in both du "cubisme" (1912) and les peintres cubistes (1913).[17]the first public controversy generated by cubism resulted from salon showings at the indépendants during the spring of 1911. this showing by metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, le fauconnier and léger brought cubism to the attention of the general public for the first time. amongst the cubist works presented, robert delaunay exhibited his eiffel tower, tour eiffel (solomon r. guggenheim museum, new york).[18]the "cubists" dominate paris' fall salon, the new york times, october 8, 1911. picasso's 1908 seated woman (meditation) is reproduced along with a photograph of the artist in his studio (upper left). metzinger's baigneuses (1908-09) is reproduced top right. also reproduced are works by derain, matisse, friesz, herbin, and a photo of braqueat the salon d'automne of the same year, in addition to the indépendants group of salle 41, were exhibited works by andré lhote, marcel duchamp, jacques villon, roger de la fresnaye, andré dunoyer de segonzac and františek kupka. the exhibition was reviewed in the october 8, 1911 issue of the new york times. this article was published a year after gelett burgess' the wild men of paris,[19] and two years prior to the armory show, which introduced astonished americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the european avant garde, including fauvism, cubism, and futurism. the 1911 new york times article portrayed works by picasso, matisse, derain, metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 salon. the article was titled the "cubists" dominate paris' fall salon and subtitled eccentric school of painting increases its vogue in the current art exhibition - what its followers attempt to do.[20][21]"among all the paintings on exhibition at the paris fall salon none is attracting so much attention as the extraordinary productions of the so-called "cubist" school. in fact, dispatches from paris suggest that these works are easily the main feature of the exhibition. [...]in spite of the crazy nature of the "cubist" theories the number of those professing them is fairly respectable. georges braque, andré derain, picasso, czobel, othon friesz, herbin, metzinger—these are a few of the names signed to canvases before which paris has stood and now again stands in blank amazement.what do they mean? have those responsible for them taken leave of their senses? is it art or madness? who knows?"[20][21]the subsequent 1912 salon des indépendants was marked by the presentation of marcel duchamp's nude descending a staircase, no. 2, which itself caused a scandal, even amongst the cubists. it was in fact rejected by the hanging committee, which included his brothers and other cubists. although the work was shown in the salon de la section d'or in october 1912 and the 1913 armory show in new york, duchamp never forgave his brothers and former colleagues for censoring his work.[15][22] juan gris, a new addition to the salon scene, exhibited his portrait of picasso (art institute of chicago), while metzinger's two showings included la femme au cheval (woman with a horse) 1911-1912 (national gallery of denmark).[23] delaunay's monumental la ville de paris (musée d'art moderne de la ville de paris) and léger's la noce, the wedding (musée national d'art moderne, paris) were also exhibited.the cubist contribution to the 1912 salon d'automne created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the grand palais, to exhibit such artwork. the indignation of the politician jean pierre philippe lampué made the front page of le journal, 5 october 1912.[24] the controversy spread to the municipal council of paris, leading to a debate in the chambre des députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such art.[25] the cubists were defended by the socialist deputy, marcel sembat.[25][26][27]it was against this background of public anger that jean metzinger and albert gleizes wrote du "cubisme" (published by eugène figuière in 1912, translated to english and russian in 1913).[28] among the works exhibited were le fauconnier's vast composition les montagnards attaqués par des ours (mountaineers attacked by bears) now at rhode island school of design museum, joseph csaky's deux femme, two women (a sculpture now lost), in addition to the highly abstract paintings by kupka, amorpha (the national gallery, prague), and picabia, la source, the spring (museum of modern art, new york).abstraction and the ready-made[edit]robert delaunay, simultaneous windows on the city, 1912, 46 x 40 cm, hamburger kunsthalle, an example of abstract cubismthe most extreme forms of cubism were not those practiced by picasso and braque, who resisted total abstraction. other cubists, by contrast, especially františek kupka, and those considered orphists by apollinaire (delaunay, léger, picabia and duchamp), accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely. kupka’s two entries at the 1912 salon d'automne, amorpha-fugue à deux couleurs and amorpha chromatique chaude, were highly abstract (or nonrepresentational) and metaphysical in orientation. both duchamp in 1912 and picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes. beginning in 1912 delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled simultaneous windows, followed by a series entitled formes circulaires, in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete. in 1913–14 léger produced a series entitled contrasts of forms, giving a similar stress to color, line and form. his cubism, despite its abstract qualities, was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life. apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract cubism in les peintres cubistes (1913),[17] writing of a new "pure" painting in which the subject was vacated. but in spite of his use of the term orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.[4]also labeled an orphist by apollinaire, marcel duchamp was responsible for another extreme development inspired by cubism. the ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the cubist construction and assemblage). the next logical step, for duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. in 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.[4]section d'or[edit]main article: section d'orthe salon d'automne of 1912, held in paris at the grand palais from 1 october to 8 november. joseph csaky’s sculpture groupe de femmes of 1911–12 is exhibited to the left, in front of two sculptures by amedeo modigliani. other works by section d'or artists are shown (left to right): františek kupka, francis picabia, jean metzinger and henri le fauconnierthe section d'or, also known as groupe de puteaux, founded by some of the most conspicuous cubists, was a collective of painters, sculptors and critics associated with cubism and orphism, active from 1911 through about 1914, coming to prominence in the wake of their controversial showing at the 1911 salon des indépendants. the salon de la section d'or at the galerie la boétie in paris, october 1912, was arguably the most important pre-world war i cubist exhibition; exposing cubism to a wide audience. over 200 works were displayed, and the fact that many of the artists showed artworks representative of their development from 1909 to 1912 gave the exhibition the allure of a cubist retrospective.[29]the group seems to have adopted the name section d'or to distinguish themselves from the narrower definition of cubism developed in parallel by pablo picasso and georges braque in the montmartre quarter of paris, and to show that cubism, rather than being an isolated art-form, represented the continuation of a grand tradition (indeed, the golden ratio had fascinated western intellectuals of diverse interests for at least 2,400 years).[30]the idea of the section d'or originated in the course of conversations between metzinger, gleizes and jacques villon. the group's title was suggested by villon, after reading a 1910 translation of leonardo da vinci's trattato della pittura by joséphin péladan.the fact that the 1912 exhibition had been curated to show the successive stages through which cubism had developed, and that du "cubisme" had been published for the occasion, indicates the artists' intention of making their work comprehensible to a wide audience (art critics, art collectors, art dealers and the general public). undoubtedly, due to the great success of the exhibition, cubism became recognized as a tendency, genre or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal.[29]late cubism: 1914-1921[edit]main article: crystal cubismcrystal cubism: 1914-1918[edit]jean metzinger, 1914-15, soldat jouant aux échecs (soldier at a game of chess, le soldat à la partie d'échecs), oil on canvas, 81.3 x 61 cm, smart museum of art, university of chicagoa significant modification of cubism between 1914 and 1916 was signaled by a shift towards a strong emphasis on large overlapping geometric planes and flat surface activity. this grouping of styles of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920, was practiced by several artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector léonce rosenberg. the tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the critic maurice raynal as 'crystal' cubism. considerations manifested by cubists prior to the outset of world war i—such as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and henri bergson's concept of duration—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference.[31]crystal cubism, and its associative rappel à l’ordre, has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the great war, both during and directly following the conflict. the purifying of cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader ideological transformation towards conservatism in both french society and french culture.[4]cubism after 1918[edit]pablo picasso, three musicians (1921), museum of modern art. three musicians is a classic example of synthetic cubism.[32]the most innovative period of cubism was before 1914. after world war i, with the support given by the dealer léonce rosenberg, cubism returned as a central issue for artists, and continued as such until the mid-1920s when its avant-garde status was rendered questionable by the emergence of geometric abstraction and surrealism in paris. many cubists, including picasso, braque, gris, léger, gleizes, and metzinger, while developing other styles, returned periodically to cubism, even well after 1925. cubism reemerged during the 1920s and the 1930s in the work of the american stuart davis and the englishman ben nicholson. in france, however, cubism experienced a decline beginning in about 1925. léonce rosenberg exhibited not only the artists stranded by kahnweiler’s exile but others including laurens, lipchitz, metzinger, gleizes, csaky, herbin and severini. in 1918 rosenberg presented a series of cubist exhibitions at his galerie de l’effort moderne in paris. attempts were made by louis vauxcelles to claim that cubism was dead, but these exhibitions, along with a well-organized cubist show at the 1920 salon des indépendants and a revival of the salon de la section d’or in the same year, demonstrated it was still alive.[4]the reemergence of cubism coincided with the appearance from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by pierre reverdy, maurice raynal and daniel-henry kahnweiler and, among the artists, by gris, léger and gleizes. the occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called neoclassicism) has been linked to the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or latin image of france during and immediately following the war. cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards conservatism in both french society and culture. yet, cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as gris and metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as braque, léger and gleizes. cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as realism or naturalism, dada, surrealism and abstraction could be compared.[4]interpretation[edit]intentions and criticism[edit]juan gris, portrait of picasso, 1912, oil on canvas, art institute of chicagothe cubism of picasso, braque and gris had more than a technical or formal significance, and the distinct attitudes and intentions of the salon cubists produced different kinds of cubism, rather than a derivative of their work. "it is by no means clear, in any case," wrote christopher green, "to what extent these other cubists depended on picasso and braque for their development of such techniques as faceting, 'passage' and multiple perspective; they could well have arrived at such practices with little knowledge of 'true' cubism in its early stages, guided above all by their own understanding of cézanne." the works exhibited by these cubists at the 1911 and 1912 salons extended beyond the conventional cézanne-like subjects—the posed model, still-life and landscape—favored by picasso and braque to include large-scale modern-life subjects. aimed at a large public, these works stressed the use of multiple perspective and complex planar faceting for expressive effect while preserving the eloquence of subjects endowed with literary and philosophical connotations.[4]in du "cubisme" metzinger and gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher henri bergson according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. the salon cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. one of the major theoretical innovations made by the salon cubists, independently of picasso and braque, was that of simultaneity,[4] drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of henri poincaré, ernst mach, charles henry, maurice princet, and henri bergson. with simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. linear perspective developed during the renaissance was vacated. the subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.[33]this technique of representing simultaneity, multiple viewpoints (or relative motion) is pushed to a high degree of complexity in gleizes' monumental le dépiquage des moissons (harvest threshing), exhibited at the 1912 salon de la section d'or, le fauconnier’s abundance shown at the indépendants of 1911, and delaunay's city of paris, shown at the indépendants in 1912. these ambitious works are some of the largest paintings in the history of cubism. léger’s the wedding, also shown at the salon des indépendants in 1912, gave form to the notion of simultaneity by presenting different motifs as occurring within a single temporal frame, where responses to the past and present interpenetrate with collective force. the conjunction of such subject matter with simultaneity aligns salon cubism with early futurist paintings by umberto boccioni, gino severini and carlo carrà; themselves made in response to early cubism.[7]cubism and modern european art was introduced into the united states at the now legendary 1913 armory show in new york city, which then traveled to chicago and boston. in the armory show pablo picasso exhibited la femme au pot de moutarde (1910), the sculpture head of a woman (fernande) (1909–10), les arbres (1907) amongst other cubist works. jacques villon exhibited seven important and large drypoints, while his brother marcel duchamp shocked the american public with his painting nude descending a staircase, no. 2 (1912). francis picabia exhibited his abstractions la danse à la source and la procession, seville (both of 1912). albert gleizes exhibited la femme aux phlox (1910) and l'homme au balcon (1912), two highly stylized and faceted cubist works. georges braque, fernand léger, raymond duchamp-villon, roger de la fresnaye and alexander archipenko also contributed examples of their cubist works.stylistic interpretation[edit]during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, europeans were discovering african, polynesian, micronesian and native american art. artists such as paul gauguin, henri matisse, and pablo picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those foreign cultures. around 1906, picasso met matisse through gertrude stein, at a time when both artists had recently acquired an interest in primitivism, iberian sculpture, african art and african tribal masks. they became friendly rivals and competed with each other throughout their careers, perhaps leading to picasso entering a new period in his work by 1907, marked by the influence of greek, iberian and african art. picasso's paintings of 1907 have been characterized as protocubism, as notably seen in les demoiselles d'avignon, the antecedent of cubism.[11]paul cézanne, quarry bibémus, 1898-1900, museum folkwang, essen, germanythe art historian douglas cooper states that paul gauguin and paul cézanne "were particularly influential to the formation of cubism and especially important to the paintings of picasso during 1906 and 1907".[34] cooper goes on to say: "the demoiselles is generally referred to as the first cubist picture. this is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards cubism it is not yet cubist. the disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. nevertheless, the demoiselles is the logical picture to take as the starting point for cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it."[11]the most serious objection to regarding the demoiselles as the origin of cubism, with its evident influence of primitive art, is that "such deductions are unhistorical", wrote the art historian daniel robbins. this familiar explanation "fails to give adequate consideration to the complexities of a flourishing art that existed just before and during the period when picasso's new painting developed."[35] between 1905 and 1908, a conscious search for a new style caused rapid changes in art across france, germany, holland, italy, and russia. the impressionists had used a double point of view, and both les nabis and the symbolists (who also admired cézanne) flattened the picture plane, reducing their subjects to simple geometric forms. neo-impressionist structure and subject matter, most notably to be seen in the works of georges seurat (e.g., parade de cirque, le chahut and le cirque), was another important influence. there were also parallels in the development of literature and social thought.[35]in addition to seurat, the roots of cubism are to be found in the two distinct tendencies of cézanne's later work: first his breaking of the painted surface into small multifaceted areas of paint, thereby emphasizing the plural viewpoint given by binocular vision, and second his interest in the simplification of natural forms into cylinders, spheres, and cones. however, the cubists explored this concept further than cézanne. they represented all the surfaces of depicted objects in a single picture plane, as if the objects had all their faces visible at the same time. this new kind of depiction revolutionized the way objects could be visualized in painting and art.jean metzinger, la femme au cheval, woman with a horse,

provenance: jacques nayral, niels bohrthe historical study of cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from sources of limited data, namely the opinions of guillaume apollinaire. it came to rely heavily on daniel-henry kahnweiler's book der weg zum kubismus (published in 1920), which centered on the developments of picasso, braque, léger, and gris. the terms "analytical" and "synthetic" which subsequently emerged have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify. neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "if kahnweiler considers cubism as picasso and braque," wrote daniel robbins, "our only fault is in subjecting other cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."[35]the traditional interpretation of "cubism", formulated post facto as a means of understanding the works of braque and picasso, has affected our appreciation of other twentieth-century artists. it is difficult to apply to painters such as jean metzinger, albert gleizes, robert delaunay and henri le fauconnier, whose fundamental differences from traditional cubism compelled kahnweiler to question whether to call them cubists at all. according to daniel robbins, "to suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in cubism is a profound mistake."[35]the history of the term "cubism" usually stresses the fact that matisse referred to "cubes" in connection with a painting by braque in 1908, and that the term was published twice by the critic louis vauxcelles in a similar context. however, the word "cube" was used in 1906 by another critic, louis chassevent, with reference not to picasso or braque but rather to metzinger and delaunay:"m. metzinger is a mosaicist like m. signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]".[35][36][37]the critical use of the word "cube" goes back at least to may 1901 when jean béral, reviewing the work of henri-edmond cross at the indépendants in art et littérature, commented that he "uses a large and square pointillism, giving the impression of mosaic. one even wonders why the artist has not used cubes of solid matter diversely colored: they would make pretty revetments." (robert herbert, 1968, p. 221)[37]the term cubism did not come into general usage until 1911, mainly with reference to metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, and léger.[35] in 1911, the poet and critic guillaume apollinaire accepted the term on behalf of a group of artists invited to exhibit at the brussels indépendants. the following year, in preparation for the salon de la section d'or, metzinger and gleizes wrote and published du "cubisme"[38] in an effort to dispel the confusion raging around the word, and as a major defence of cubism (which had caused a public scandal following the 1911 salon des indépendants and the 1912 salon d'automne in paris).[39] clarifying their aims as artists, this work was the first theoretical treatise on cubism and it still remains the clearest and most intelligible. the result, not solely a collaboration between its two authors, reflected discussions by the circle of artists who met in puteaux and courbevoie. it mirrored the attitudes of the "artists of passy", which included picabia and the duchamp brothers, to whom sections of it were read prior to publication.[4][35] the concept developed in du "cubisme" of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously, i.e., the act of moving around an object to seize it from several successive angles fused into a single image (multiple viewpoints, mobile perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity), is a generally recognized device used by the cubists.[33]the 1912 manifetso du "cubisme" by metzinger and gleizes was followed in 1913 by les peintres cubistes, a collection of reflections and commentaries by guillaume apollinaire.[17] apollinaire had been closely involved with picasso beginning in 1905, and braque beginning in 1907, but gave as much attention to artists such as metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, picabia, and duchamp.[4]cubist sculpture[edit]pablo picasso, 1909–10, head of a womanside view, bronze sculpture modeled on

sculpture is rooted in paul cézanne's reduction of painted objects into component planes and geometric solids (cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones). and just as in painting, it became a pervasive influence and contributed fundamentally to constructivism and futurism.cubist sculpture developed in parallel to cubist painting. during the autumn of 1909 picasso sculpted head of a woman (fernande) with positive features depicted by negative space and vice versa. according to douglas cooper: "the first true cubist sculpture was picasso's impressive woman's head, modeled in 1909–10, a counterpart in three dimensions to many similar analytical and faceted heads in his paintings at the time."[10] these positive/negative reversals were ambitiously exploited by alexander archipenko in 1912–13, for example in woman walking.[4] joseph csaky, after archipenko, was the first sculptor in paris to join the cubists, with whom he exhibited from 1911 onwards. they were followed by raymond duchamp-villon and then in 1914 by jacques lipchitz, henri laurens and ossip zadkine.[41][42]indeed, cubist construction was as influential as any pictorial cubist innovation. it was the stimulus behind the proto-constructivist work of both naum gabo and vladimir tatlin and thus the starting-point for the entire constructive tendency in 20th-century modernist sculpture.[4]architecture[edit]le corbusier, assembly building, chandigarh, indiacubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture.[43] the historical, theoretical, and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting, sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in france, germany, the netherlands and czechoslovakia. though there are many points of intersection between cubism and architecture, only a few direct links between them can be drawn. most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics: faceting of form, spatial ambiguity, transparency, and multiplicity.[43]architectural interest in cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form, using simple geometric shapes, juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective. diverse elements could be superimposed, made transparent or penetrate one another, while retaining their spatial relationships. cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 (la maison cubiste, by raymond duchamp-villon and andré mare) onwards, developing in parallel with architects such as peter behrens and walter gropius, with the simplification of building design, the use of materials appropriate to industrial production, and the increased use of glass.[44]le corbusier, centre le corbusier (heidi weber museum) in zurich-seefeld (zürichhorn)cubism was relevant to an architecture seeking a style that needed not refer to the past. thus, what had become a revolution in both painting and sculpture was applied as part of "a profound reorientation towards a changed world".[44][45] the cubo-futurist ideas of filippo tommaso marinetti influenced attitudes in avant-garde architecture. the influential de stijl movement embraced the aesthetic principles of neo-plasticism developed by piet mondrian under the influence of cubism in paris. de stijl was also linked by gino severini to cubist theory through the writings of albert gleizes. however, the linking of basic geometric forms with inherent beauty and ease of industrial application—which had been prefigured by marcel duchamp from 1914—was left to the founders of purism, amédée ozenfant and charles-édouard jeanneret (better known as le corbusier,) who exhibited paintings together in paris and published après le cubisme in 1918.[44] le corbusier's ambition had been to translate the properties of his own style of cubism to architecture. between 1918 and 1922, le corbusier concentrated his efforts on purist theory and painting. in 1922, le corbusier and his cousin jeanneret opened a studio in paris at 35 rue de sèvres. his theoretical studies soon advanced into many different architectural projects.[46]la maison cubiste (cubist house)[edit]main article: la maison cubisteraymond duchamp-villon, 1912, study for la maison cubiste, projet d'hotel (cubist house). image published in les peintres cubistes, by guillaume apollinaire, 17 march 1913at the 1912 salon d'automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as maison cubiste (cubist house), signed raymond duchamp-villon and andré mare along with a group of collaborators. metzinger and gleizes in du "cubisme", written during the assemblage of the "maison cubiste", wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. decorative work, to them, was the "antithesis of the picture". "the true picture" wrote metzinger and gleizes, "bears its raison d'être within itself. it can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. it does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...".[47]jacques doucet's hôtel particulier, 33 rue saint-james, neuilly-sur-seine"mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes christopher green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of gleizes and metzinger themselves, but of marie laurencin, the duchamp brothers (raymond duchamp-villon designed the facade) and mare's old friends léger and roger la fresnaye".[48] la maison cubiste was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the salon bourgeois, where paintings by marcel duchamp, metzinger (woman with a fan), gleizes, laurencin and léger were hung—and a bedroom. it was an example of l'art décoratif, a home within which cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. spectators at the salon d'automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by duchamp-villon.[49] this architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 armory show, new york, chicago and boston,[50] listed in the catalogue of the new york exhibit as raymond duchamp-villon, number 609, and entitled "facade architectural, plaster" (façade architecturale).[51][52]several years after world war i, in 1927, cubists joseph csaky, jacques lipchitz, louis marcoussis, henri laurens, the sculptor gustave miklos, and others collaborated in the decoration of a studio house, rue saint-james, neuilly-sur-seine, designed by the architect paul ruaud and owned by the french fashion designer jacques doucet, also a collector of post-impressionist and cubist paintings (including les demoiselles d'avignon, which he bought directly from picasso's studio). laurens designed the fountain, csaky designed doucet's staircase,[53] lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and marcoussis made a cubist rug.[54][55][56]czech cubist architecture[edit]house of the black madonna in prague, built by josef gočár in 1912the original cubist architecture is very rare. there is only one country in the world where cubism was really applied to architecture – namely bohemia (today czech republic) and especially its capital, prague.[57][58] czech architects were the first and only ones in the world to ever design original cubist buildings.[59] cubist architecture flourished for the most part between 1910–1914, but the cubist or cubism-influenced buildings were also built after the world war i. after the war, the architectural style called rondo-cubism was developed in prague fusing the cubist architecture with round shapes.[60]villa kovařovic in prague by josef chocholin their theoretical rules, the cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. this should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut, or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late gothic architecture. in this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. the grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. hexagonal windows.[60] czech cubist architects also designed cubist furniture.the leading cubist architects were pavel janák, josef gočár, vlastislav hofman, emil králíček and josef chochol.[60] they worked mostly in prague but also in other bohemian towns. the best-known cubist building is the house of the black madonna in the old town of prague built in 1912 by josef gočár with the only cubist café in the world, grand café orient.[57] vlastislav hofman built the entrance pavilions of ďáblice cemetery in 1912–1914, josef chochol designed several residential houses under vyšehrad. a cubist streetlamp has also been preserved near the wenceslas square, designed by emil králíček in 1912, who also built the diamond house in the new town of prague around 1913.cubism in other fields[edit]the influence of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. in literature, the written works of gertrude stein employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. most of stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel the making of americans (1906–08). not only were they the first important patrons of cubism, gertrude stein and her brother leo were also important influences on cubism as well. picasso in turn was an important influence on stein's writing.in the field of american fiction, william faulkner's 1930 novel as i lay dying can be read as an interaction with the cubist mode. the novel features narratives of the diverse experiences of 15 characters which, when taken together, produce a single cohesive body.the poets generally associated with cubism are guillaume apollinaire, blaise cendrars, jean cocteau, max jacob, andré salmon and pierre reverdy. as american poet kenneth rexroth explains, cubism in poetry "is the conscious, deliberate dissociation and recombination of elements into a new artistic entity made self-sufficient by its rigorous architecture. this is quite different from the free association of the surrealists and the combination of unconscious utterance and political nihilism of dada."[61] nonetheless, the cubist poets' influence on both cubism and the later movements of dada and surrealism was profound; louis aragon, founding member of surrealism, said that for breton, soupault, éluard and himself, reverdy was "our immediate elder, the exemplary poet."[62] though not as well remembered as the cubist painters, these poets continue to influence and inspire; american poets john ashbery and ron padgett have recently produced new translations of reverdy's work. wallace stevens' "thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird" is also said to demonstrate how cubism's multiple perspectives can be translated into poetry.[63]it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of cubism. it was a revolution in the visual arts as great as that which took place in the early renaissance. its effects on later art, on film, and on architecture are already so numerous that we hardly notice them. (john berger)[64]cubism:  a new visionthe birth of cubism            the art movement known as cubism arose out of the need to define and represent the then new modern reality. this new reality was complex and ambiguous, shaped by new inventions, philosophical speculation and cultural diversity. the new technology and scientific discoveries were radically changing the pace of life and the way society perceived the nature of things. whereas in the past, life had been static, science and technology were now forcing modern man to experience time, motion and space more dynamically. all of a sudden he was thrust in a world of expanding vision and horizons, of accelerated tempo and mobility and of fluctuating perspectives. furthermore, the ambiguity and sense of uncertainty generated by this new rush of stimuli was interpreted by the theory of relativity that evolved through f. h. bradley, whitehead, einstein, and the new mathematics. what these philosophical theoreticians suggested was that we live in a world of shifting perspectives, where the appearance of objects is in a constant flux depending on the point of view from which it is seen. finally, the experience of reality was also being altered by the cultural interactions taking place between the east and west, the primitive and the industrialized. in other words, each culture brought along with it a new, idiosyncratic way of looking at things, and the interchange occurring between cultures obscured the perception of truth. relativity became everything.the problem facing the modern artist became how to formally depict this new dynamic vision of life. for the painter, specifically, the dilemma became representing the flux of time, motion and space in a medium that lent itself to the mere capture of the fleeting moment. cubism was born as a response to this predicament, and it is no accident that the movement was a parisian phenomenon, considering the city's artistic legacy and its magnetic ability to attract the most gifted young artists and writers from all over the world. paris offered them great art museums, a tradition of moral and artistic freedom, and an artistic bohemia where they could live cheaply on the margin of bourgeois society.perhaps we can say that pablo picasso's les demoiselles d'avignon ushered in a revolutionary way of depicting reality. this landmark painting had broken all of the traditional rules that artists at the time followed, especially the one that defined art as imitation rather than creation. picasso had decided to turn his back on a fixed point of view and harmonious proportion, concepts that had been religiously practiced since the renaissance. instead, he replaced these with multiple perspectives and distortion. furthermore, he incorporated into his painting references to primitive art, a practice that ran counter to the ceremonious adulation of the whole continuum of western art. for most people, les demoiselles was a desecration of everything that had been held as sacred. but fortunately, picasso's rebelliousness cleared the air for what was to come: a freedom to create rather than imitate and to construct a new pictorial language.cubism was born out of the interaction and collaboration that occurred between picasso and georges braque right after they met in 1907. when braque saw les demoiselles for the first time, he went into a state of shock. however, many months after this initial encounter and much reflection, braque reconsidered his initial reaction and responded with large nude (1908), in which he follows picasso's lead and combines several points of view in one image. soon afterwards, an artistic partnership developed between the two artists that was to define the nature of painting for years to come. at first, picasso was concerned with the formal and technical freedoms that african art and masks had inspired while braque experimented with the revolutionary innovations in les demoiselles. picasso's dryad (1907) captures the tribal stance as well as the formal distortion and coarse hatching and scoring of primitive art. but braque would have a sobering voice in this artistic relationship. his function was to neutralize picasso's artistic savagery by incorporating it into paul cezanne's more conservative formal legacy of reducing reality to basic geometrical shapes that are clearly connected with one another. out of this artistic reconciliation, analytical cubism, the first phase in the evolution of cubism, was born.large nude (1908)dryad (1908)in the beginning of their artistic partnership, picasso and braque had become consumed with cezanne’s feeling for the “architecture” that underlies nature and with his statement that “everything in nature is based on the sphere, cone, and cylinder.”  cezanne’s work also suggested to picasso and braque that art was neither an imitation nor an illusion of reality, but, in effect, a new kind of reality, created through the means of a new “language” of forms. for cézanne, a picture is important in its own right, and thus, it must remain faithful to itself. thus the aim of painting is not to pretend that the viewer is looking through a window, but to make the viewer aware of the picture surface itself as well as the subject matter it depicts. picasso and braque took both of these notions one step further.  whereas cezanne believed that the study of an object was the real solution to all of the painter's problems, picasso and braque had become totally absorbed by the problem of representing the complexity of reality in art. because they lived in an age which was very distinct from cezanne's, their perception of reality was different. they believed that our knowledge of things was composed of its multiple relations to each other and change their appearance according to the point of view from which we see them. furthermore, they perceived the cubist object as the point at which thought about the object intersects our sense impressions and feelings about it. analytical cubism:  mapping reality as its name implies, the paintings associated with the analytical cubism phase show evidence of a methodology through which picasso and braque used to "break down" the surface of the objects being represented into basic, geometrical shapes. picasso's woman with a fan (1908) is a volumetric study of a woman whose features are simplified into spheres and triangles and suggests a sculptor at work, as indeed picasso was. it is cézanne taken to the extreme. another painting that shows the difference in pictorial technique between the cubists and cézanne is houses at l'estaque (1908). here, braque borrows the same colors and geometric shapes that cézanne uses in his mont sainte-victoire paintings. but here the similarity ends, for a panoramic, fixed view of the landscape is not enough for braque. what braque does is subordinate color in order to attain a geometric structure of overlapping, shifting, tilted cubes that seem to project out of and into the picture plane, as though we were watching a 3-d movie. the effect that is created is not that of a single-point linear perspective, rather, that of a scene changing as it is observed from various positions. in other words, braque was trying to record the process of seeing, and, in order to do so, he has constructed a composite of several different simultaneous views of the objects to be viewed in one synthetic moment. by doing this, braque transformed the canvas from being the static record of a fleeting moment to a more dynamic vision akin to moving pictures. the canvas, then, became like a screen onto which images are projected.woman with a fan (1908)houses at l'estaque (1908)         by 1909, pablo picasso and georges braque both felt that cubism was becoming stagnant because the two of them had already pushed their original analytical investigations to their logical conclusions and that, consequently, it was their duty to regenerate cubism if it was not to degenerate into just another banal picture formula. their next step was to focus on the structure of objects by depicting them through a grid-like scaffolding system on which the objects' many aspects, including those hidden from sight, are displayed in a facet-like, fragmented manner. in braque's still life violin and palette (1909), the objects are still recognizable, but they are presented in a radical new manner. it's almost as if braque has taken the violin, shattered it into bits and pieces, and then holds it so that we can see all of the violin's fragments as they move around still part of its main structure. through what appears to be a still intact, shattered violin twisting in the wind so that all aspects can be experienced concurrently, braque is able to convey metamorphosis, simultaneity and consecutive vision. furthermore, braque portrays this new dynamic world through a pictorial composition that suggests a cascading waterfall of tilted, transparent planes hovering on the flat surface of the painting. in order to represent the ambiguity of objects as seen by the spectator whose perception of reality has been altered by the pace of modernity, braque now break ups forms in an almost explosive manner, splintering them into a multiplicity of tiny planes and then reassembling them. the resulting shapes are crystalline and jewel-like in appearance, creating a complex kaleidoscope of forms.	 violin and palette (1909).           picasso's woman with mandolin (1910) further illustrates the groundwork that was being laid by these two artists. picasso, always the sculptor, fragments the girl's body into facets that are modeled to simulate their projection out of the flat picture plane toward the viewer and that portray her in movement as she strums her mandolin. what picasso is trying to depict here is the fourth dimension, the space/time continuum. in his introduction to metaphysics of 1903, henri bergson argues that human consciousness experiences space and time as ever-changing and heterogeneous. with the passage of time, an observer accumulates in his memory a store of perceptual information about a given object in the external visible world, and this accumulated experience becomes the basis for the observer’s conceptual knowledge of that object. by contrast, the intellect or reasoning faculty always represents time and space as homogenous. bergson argued that intellectual perception led to a fundamentally false representation of the nature of things, that in nature nothing is ever absolutely still. instead the universe is in a constant state of change or flux. an observer views an object and its surrounding environment as a continuum, fusing into one another. the task of metaphysics, according to bergson, is to find ways to capture this flux, especially as it is expressed in consciousness. to represent this flux of reality, picasso began to make references to the fourth dimension by "sticking together" several three-dimensional spaces in a row.	girl with mandolin (1910) the fourth dimension                    these new ideas about a reality that is in a constant state of constant flux injected the element of doubt in picasso and braque’s ongoing debate about the nature of the artistic process. how does one, they asked themselves, capture the ethereal, shifting quality of reality, where object and environment become inseparable? how does one reconcile the intellectual and intuitive faculties when they appear so antithetical? what then is the relationship between the coherent artifice of traditional “realistic” art and the incoherent processes by which we experience our environment, between renaissance perspective and multiple points of view as a result of the acceleration of the pace of modern life? where does the spectator stand? and the object? the result of these rhetorical questions, the paintings of 1910-11 probe further and further into the nature of realistic illusions and gradually refine the balance in which the spectator was poised, between the internal world of the painting’s structure and the external world of its references to reality. now picasso and braque’s concern shifted to creating a new artistic language that would express the multiplicity and complexity of these relationships and, at the same time, suggest stability. what they jointly developed was a new kind of painting, one that emphasized pictorial configuration rather than motif, thus moving in the direction of abstraction. to achieve this new pictorial structure, picasso and braque replaced the traditional perspective by a shallow space in which there is little distance between figure, foreground and background. consequently, the eye is not led back into an imaginary distance but is held on the painting’s surface, and yet, at the same time, is invited to experience three-dimensionality in a new way. the artist is now free to break apart the object into small facets or pieces and distribute them about the canvas as the composition requires. the painter can show the back, front or side of an object simultaneously. art historians refer to this phase of cubism as “facet cubism,” “high analytic cubism” and            by the end of 1910, picasso further explores this new phase of analytical cubism in portrait of ambrose vollard although he is still committed to the rendering of the particulars of his subject matter.  picasso’s great power as a caricaturist is demonstrated in this painting, in which a powerful floating bald head, the defining characteristic, emerges as the product of several combined viewpoints from the muted monochromes of an angular maze.  in this painting the figure of picasso's famous art dealer has dissolved into the cubist grid, with only his facial structure, protruding jawbones, pug nose, the color and texture of ruddy flesh and light-brown hair, beard and mustache.  vollard is seated facing us; behind him is a table, on which are a bottle, on his right, and a book, perhaps a ledger, on his left.  picasso has even included the handkerchief in vollard’s pocket.  the famous dealer is portrayed as being very cerebral as he gazes downward at a rectangular shape, which judging from his expression of shrewd critical discernment may be a work of art.  the whole surface of the painting is a series of small, intersecting planes, any one of which can be interpreted as being both behind and in front of other, adjoining planes. 	portrait of ambrose vollard (1910)     the accordionist (1911)          this reductive, fragmenting process is taken even further in the accordionist (1911), where the figure has been so fragmented that it is no longer apparent what is being represented, and so the title purveys the clue as to the nature of its subject matter.  the triangular scaffolding grid provides the structure on which to suspend the almost unrecognizable fragments of this musician.  the only recognizable vestiges of the accordionist’s instrument are the keys and bellows shown fragmented from multiple viewpoints, located center left of the painting.  more than an analysis, this painting is an assembling of parts. the consequence of braque and picasso's experimentation was true liberation from the renaissance' concept of conceiving the world from the static point of view of geometrical perspective and of portraying painting as an act of imitation. this break with the past entitled artists to all kinds of new possibilities. synthetic cubism:  vision of modern urban life      picasso and braque's experimentation with the very concept of constructing a work of art lead them into the final phase of cubism--synthetic cubism. as its name implies, synthetic cubism worked on the premise of assembling out of separate parts new forms. what they were trying to recreate in this phase of cubism is how modern urban street life appears to the onlooker.  whereas in the analytical phase picasso and braque were deconstructing and then reassembling bits and pieces to suggest objects as seen from multiple angles, in this latter phase they were interested in superimposing  fragments one on top of another to simulate walls plastered with posters as well as stacked newspaper displays at kiosks. furthermore, they no longer concerned themselves with the representation of space because now the emphasis was on digesting multiple layers of information and shapes. the end results were compositions that were simpler, brighter, and bolder accomplished through the following techniques:bringing together familiar scraps and unfamiliar forms in order to give shape to a particular sense of urban lifeexploring the individual experiences associated with public spaces and urban recreationusing the language of publicity and commerce in an ambiguous manner to suggest a multiplicity of contradictory meanings, especially through punscapturing the new sense of simultaneity of diverse experiences-the fusion of objects, people, machines, noises, light, smells, etc.          how was it that picasso and braque decided to change the way that they were depicting reality? while picasso preferred the more traditional subject matter of nudes and portraits, braque oscillated to still lifes and landscapes.   nevertheless, it is around this time that picasso and braque began to paint like twins, their work becoming undistinguishable from one another. color, texture, and linear structure are almost the same.  but braque, ever the pragmatist, nudged picasso by reminding him that their work was becoming so abstract that subject matter was no longer recognizable.   in order to bring painting back to reality, braque introduced a new element to their work--visually realistic objects taken from popular culture.   even before this point in the evolution of cubism, picasso had already pasted a small piece of paper on the center of a drawing to make what was the first papier collé or collage in 1908.  as early as 1910, both artists had been incorporating words, letters and numbers into their paintings, and braque, in particular, had used trompe-l'oeil wood-grain effects.  this technique came naturally to braque since he had been a house painter before becoming an artist.             by re-instating recognizable elements from everyday life into their paintings, picasso and braque were asking a very important rhetorical question about the very nature of art:  what is more real, art or reality?  through their further exploration of this question, picasso and braque seemed to be implying that they are both just as real for they can co-exist on the same plane, the same canvas.  all of a sudden both of these artists introduced bits of observed nature onto the canvas, as well as products of modern industry: sheet music, newspaper, playing cards and restaurant menus.  as in music, picasso and braque were employing scraps of reality as counterpoints to the abstract structures created through paint.  again, picasso and braque had revolutionized the world of art.  this new phase in the evolution of cubism became known as collage.           picasso's first collage is still life with chair caning (1911-12), on which he embeds a piece of oilcloth that simulates chair caning.  what picasso seems to be suggesting here is that there are many different levels of reality, for the oilcloth itself is a manufactured representation of another craft--caning.  looking closely at this collage, it appears that the painted parts of the work depict a glass in the center, behind which lies a copy of the newspaper le journal (hence the letters jou) and a white clay pipe.  to the right are two lemon slices and a knife, and below them what might be an oyster shell.  the shadows or refractions from the glass lie across the oilcloth, and towards the bottom edge of the canvas a brown strip seems to represent the front edge of the table. finally, the oval shape of the painting is “framed” by a piece of real rope.  what picasso has managed to do here besides reminding us that manufactured materials, words, and even art are all similar in that they are means of representing reality and that, furthermore, by including them all together he has challenged the traditional demand that artists should strive for artistic unity.  thus their juxtaposition in the same picture makes the point about the nature of language but also blurs the distinction between them.   even the oval shape of the canvas signifies something else: the seat of a chair or the surface of the café table on which the objects sit.    since the french word for an easel picture is tableau, picasso delights in the joke that his picture is a vertical tableau which is also a horizontal table.   	still life with chair caning (1912)          just as picasso and braque’s art had explored the philosophical ideas of bradley, whitehead, and bergson, they now began to flirt with the inclusion of verbal and musical language in their works.  at the turn of the century, linguists in europe and the united states had begun to wonder what language really was and how to describe it, leading to a new appreciation of the importance of structures and codes to linguistic meaning and the arbitrary accidental nature of the way language describes reality.  these ideas became the basis of the study of signs known as semiotics.  although picasso and braque couldn’t have been more removed from these academic studies, their work of this period, nevertheless, is a testament to their questioning the relationship between art, language and representation.             although it was braque who invented the idea of collage, it was picasso who first executed it.  however, braque invented and executed the first papier collé, a kind of collage consisting of papers that are glued onto the canvas. braque’s inclusion of paper seems to be analogous to the addition of the oilcloth.  but braque’s use of wallpaper does this and more.  what braque has discovered here is that there are ready-made materials that simulate “woodness,” that do not have to be drawn or painted and that can be cut up and manipulated, that are always the same no matter what the “light” in the picture, and that can appear independently of the shape of the object of which they are meant to be a part. braque has added the element of materialism into painting.  so instead of painting something onto the canvas, he just glued it on--whether it be newspaper scraps, wallpaper, paper printed to resemble something else, advertisements, etc.  furthermore, braque used all kinds of decorative painting techniques learned from his days as a house painter.  he incorporated combing, faux graining, and adding sawdust and sand for texture. braque also added shadows with graphite and charcoal thereby mixing drawing and painting techniques. a case in point is braque's woman with a guitar (1913) in which the artist assembles a woman playing a guitar from different layers of shapes, colors, and ready-made materials stacked to create her essence.woman with a guitar (1913)           so why were picasso and braque incorporating mundane materials such as oil cloth and wallpaper?  one suggestion comes from a purported conversation between picasso and his mistress francois gilot that took place many years later:we tried to get rid of trompe l’oeil to find a trompe l’esprit (deception of the mind/spirit).  we didn’t any longer want to fool the eye; we wanted to fool the mind.  the sheet of newspaper was never used in order to make a newspaper.  it was used to become a bottle or something like that.  it was never used literally but always as an element displaced from its habitual definition at the point of departure and its new definition at the point of arrival.  if a piece of newspaper can become a bottle, that gives us something to think about in connection with both newspapers and bottles, too.  the displaced object has its strangeness.  and this strangeness was what we wanted to make people think about because we were quite aware that our world was becoming very strange and not exactly reassuring.collage and papier collé gave picasso and braque the opportunity to pursue the estrangement as well as the diversity of modern life.  furthermore, introducing real objects into their paintings allowed them to remove the distinctions between what is real and what is created by the artist, between art and mass-produced objects, and between painting, drawing, and commercial art.  as picasso himself said, “art is a lie that helps us understand the truth.”           while picasso and braque were experimenting, a coterie of artists were scrutinizing what these two leaders were doing, came under their influence, exhibited together and ultimately were labeled as being cubists also. next to picasso and braque, juan gris was perhaps the most famous of this group. as a matter of fact, his work, which was from the beginning synthetic in nature, probably inspiring picasso and braque to bring back light and color into their canvases. his style can best be described as having intensely colored geometric planes which combine with familiar collage components to create a tightly interlocked pictorial harmony.  	still life with open window (1915)          another important cubist was fernand leger, whose contribution to the art movement was the celebration of the new machine age. leger created his images of machine forms and robots from cylinders and cones, the basic building blocks of his work. the ultimate effect of his work is a harmonious mechanical world where man happily participates.three women (1921)         robert delaunay was a cubist who steered away from the still life and the figure, embracing the architectural image of the eiffel tower and the plane as the images of modernity. in his paintings, delaunay was interested in capturing the whole dynamics of the new cult of the machine. in his eiffel tower paintings, delaunay portrayed the tower as it loomed over the city during construction, arising out of it like the new phoenix. in homage to bleriot, the artist celebrates the new dynamism of the new industrial age by painting vibrating discs of color that simulate plane propellers in motion.  	homage to bleriot (1913)cubism constitutes one of the greatest revolutions in the history of western art, on a par with the one launched at the beginning of the fifteenth century by two other young artists, in another booming economic and cultural center permitting radical innovations within the realms of the arts and sciences—though florence, at the time that filippo brunelleschi and donatello reached their first heights in the early quattrocento, was an undoubtedly quieter place than was early twentieth-century paris when pablo picasso and georges braque reached theirs.why is such a comparison worthwhile, one might wonder? for one, because both cases involved two artists who, while competing fiercely, profoundly inspired each other as they broke away from the living visual tradition around them. additionally, it seems to me that the political, social, cultural, and economic conditions encountered both in florence and paris have a great deal to do with the emergence of these new artistic languages, namely the early renaissance and analytic cubism. the triumph of the merchant class and the administrative know-how and hunger for glory of the guilds enabled the flowering of the renaissance in florence; and the amount of images and ideas being bandied around paris, hothouse of both technological and scientific breakthroughs, makes it the vital locus for the development of cubism from 1908 to 1914, as the french capital was a place where avant-garde practice mattered, and where the ambitious artist who played her or his cards well could show work and cultivate an audience.significantly, however, the cubist style was developed by outsiders—one from málaga, spain, and the other raised and trained at le havre, about 120 miles to the west of paris—who were, because of this, particularly sensitive to the wide variety of data to which they were exposed. this is not unlike the conditions that existed when the baroque style was launched by the outsiders annibale carracci and michelangelo merisi da caravaggio, circa 1600, in another great capital, rome—though those artists did not establish the type of intellectual partnership brunelleschi and donatello had formed, and that braque and picasso would.viewers are not encouraged to make connections of this sort at the cubism: the leonard a. lauder collection exhibition and in its accompanying catalogue. the tradition out of which cubism arose is not at all addressed in the heavy publication, and the “city of light” as pulsating metropolis is barely acknowledged. but the place where conventions are shattered through the introduction of new paradigms—and with renewed vigor since the early enlightenment—is the very place to find an entirely new art emerge that, for the first time in the history of western art (ornament excluded), aimed to give visual form to extreme forms of ambiguity and complexity. to such an extent, in fact, that a century later it can still be challenging to decipher exactly what we are looking at in certain cubist works. romanesque and mannerist art did not reach comparable degrees of visual opacity.what i am saying here has undoubtedly been stated elsewhere and more eloquently than space permits, but even if so, shouldn’t this fascinating story be retold with a twist at the beginning of this exhibition and in the essay opening the catalogue? instead, cubism is presented as a fait accompli, coming about practically in a vacuum, as it were, the catalyst being les demoiselles d’avignon (1907), picasso’s bewildering transitional painting. but cubism did not emerge out of nowhere; instead, it engaged head on with the history of art. in analytic cubist painting, solid form was gradually abandoned in favor of incomplete armatures built up of facets and signs, opening up the bodies to the surrounding space, and with seemingly contradictory transitions in shading—a more rabidly anti-academic type of painting can hardly be imagined.allow me to expand a little more on cubism and the history of art. the mark as signifier—meaning one thing in one place within the composition, and something different in another—can be traced back to early impressionist pictures by claude monet. however, analytic cubism moves away from the rich color scheme of impressionism, postimpressionism, and fauvism—styles that had already gone far into the dematerialization of form—toward beige, brown, and gray tonalities, which in my view (besides pursuing leonardo’s goal of tonal unity) were part of a playful attempt to make an art for the museums, à la rembrandt. impressionism had, after all, landed in the national collection at the musée du luxembourg, paris, through the bequest of the painter and collector gustave caillebotte, and by 1908, three among the four principal postimpressionist painters were celebrated through important posthumous retrospective exhibitions.the oval format of certain cubist pictures that focus upon the still-life motif by lobbing off the corners of the traditional rectangular painting—which picasso and braque covered with feathery brushstrokes rich in atmosphere, as they had nothing else to place there (i echo william rubin here)—that format (picasso, the scallop shell: “notre avenir est dans l’air,” 1912) goes back to the french rococo, while the much rarer circular format (not represented in the lauder collection) evokes the renaissance. however, it is worth noting that the rococo is about pleasure, and that so much cubist painting is so clearly not about that—the sitters (who are almost always alone) are melancholic, the early landscapes forlorn, the still lifes at times ominous. why? and why is this passed over in the exhibition catalogue? also, although landscape—a classical genre rediscovered during the renaissance—was crucial to cubism’s early development (braque, trees at l’estaque, 1908), it eventually vanished from the pre-war work of picasso and braque. why did that occur?the still lifes—another renaissance rediscovery—may show a sliver of newspaper, and newsprint may be included in certain drawings showing either still life or the figure (picasso, head of a man, 1912), thereby introducing istoria (edifying narrative) through the back door, as it were. for, while it does so, cubism carries on the avant-garde’s move away from history painting (long considered the highest form of painting, since being so proclaimed by leon battista alberti in his treatise on painting of 1435), an act of rebellion that was initiated circa 1848 by gustave courbet. the newsprint becomes a kind of black-on-white pointillism, a playful response to georges seurat, who was steeped in color theory and had given—as alberti had—new meaning to painting as science. the news (les nouvelles) included in this new art (un art nouvel) also alludes to time streaming by.the exhibition celebrates a promised gift to the metropolitan museum of art by leonard a. lauder of eighty works by picasso, braque, juan gris, and fernand léger spanning 1906–24, the first two artists being the co-inventors of the style that took off like wildfire circa 1911, and the latter two artists being among the most inventive ones working within the language of cubism. with this promised gift of paintings, drawings (often cum papiers collés, or vice versa), and sculpture, new york city will become—thanks to the combined holdings of the metropolitan museum of art, the museum of modern art, and the solomon r. guggenheim museum—an essential place for deepening one’s understanding of the developments leading to the emergence of the cubist style in 1908, and that style’s evolution over the course of the next six years; that is, until the first world war tore braque away from his comrade-in-arms, picasso, leading to one of the great what ifs in the history of twentieth-century art. (the dialogue between these artists was not resumed once braque returned—severely wounded—from battle.)coincidentally, perhaps, this exhibition opened exactly one century after the fascinating artistic exchange between braque and picasso was concluded. that dialogue was the subject of an intellectually riveting and profoundly moving exhibition, picasso and braque: pioneering cubism, organized by rubin a quarter of a century ago (1989) for the museum of modern art. it is unfair to compare this exhibition to the earlier one, as lauder could only collect what remained available to him and met his standards, while rubin could draw from a wide variety of public and private collections. nevertheless, i laud lauder’s focus upon the production of a limited number of years in the careers of the two spanish and two french cubist masters.that said, lauder’s shadow looms too large. the collection is gone over exhaustively and with far too much reverence in the catalogue, as if all works were of equal merit, making for painfully tedious reading at times, as the essays are almost all structured in the same way, despite the gathering of close to twenty essayists, many among them well known. too few risks are taken, though cubism was all about disrupting the status quo. dryness prevails, though cubism was packed with humor and was nothing less than visually and intellectually thrilling.additionally, no preliminary explanation is given about how the works are divided over the twenty-two catalogue essays. as the works in the collection are not illustrated in chronological order, but instead in the order in which they are discussed in the essays, and furthermore are interspersed with lots of comparative material, one can spend some time fishing around to find a specific image. surely, this book could have been made easier to navigate.at the metropolitan museum of art, the first gallery was reserved for works by braque, the second for works by picasso, the third almost exclusively for braque, the fourth for mostly works on paper by picasso and braque; all the works by gris were displayed in the fifth gallery, works by picasso and braque were featured in the sixth room, and the seventh and final gallery was devoted to the work of léger. marvelous risk-taking was displayed by all throughout these galleries. one only wishes that it would have been possible to experience these works as others first got to see them, and not only because one would like to see them in better physical shape (the newspaper collage in the drawings, for example, has turned brown, thereby disrupting the values throughout these compositions). indeed, one would like to recapture the unsettling power of these works, instead of being almost conditioned to take these experiments in modernism for granted. cubism is now widely appreciated, judging by the crowds in the galleries.more questions remain. why did these artists hardly ever experiment with different types of pictorial support during the years under consideration—such as wood, metal, or glass (the first two materials were, however, deployed by picasso in his painted cubist sculpture, which proved to be of such enormous consequence)—in order to achieve different textural effects, other types of luminosity, and with the glass, forms that become even more slick or diaphanous than they can appear on canvas. were the frames around the paintings selected—either haphazardly or after careful deliberation—by the artists, their dealers, or by collectors? which brings us to the early marketing and collecting of these deliciously strange things, about which the catalogue says very little. i ask so much because cubism remains so very exciting. happily, more remains to be done.introduction: revolutionary abstract artin fine art, the term cubism describes the revolutionary style of painting invented by pablo picasso (1881-1973) and georges braque (1882-1963) in paris, during the period 1907-12. their cubist methods - initially influenced by the geometric motifs in the landscape compositions of the post-impressionist painter paul cezanne - radically redefined the nature and scope of fine art painting and, to a lesser extent, sculpture, as previously practised, and heralded entirely new ways of representing reality. to this extent, cubism marks the end of the renaissance-dominated era, and the beginning of modern art.largely a type of semi abstract art - although at times it approaches full-blown non-objective art - cubism is traditionally classified into three stages:(1) early cubist painting (1907-9)(2) analytical cubism (1909-12)(3) synthetic cubism (1912-14)in addition to braque and picasso, other famous artists who were closely associated with the movement include the painters juan gris (1887-1927), fernand leger (1881-1955), robert delaunay (1885-1941), albert gleizes (1881-1953), andre lhote (1885-1962), roger de la fresnaye (1885-1925), jean metzinger (1883-1956), francis picabia (1879-1953), the versatile artist marcel duchamp (1887-1968), and the sculptors jacques lipchitz (1891-1973), alexander archipenko (1887-1964). (see cubist painters, and 20th century sculptors.) cubism was the starting point for, or an essential element in, a number of other modern art movements, including futurism (1909-14), orphism (1910-13), vorticism (1914-15), russian constructivism, (c.1919-1932), and dada (1916-1924).harlequin with guitar (1919)by juan gris. private collection.twentieth century artistsfor a quick reference guide,see: 20th century painters. evolution of visual artfor details of art movementsand styles, see: history of art.for the chronology and datesof key events in the evolutionof visual arts around the worldsee: history of art timeline.world's greatest artworksfor a list of the top 10 painters/sculptors: best artists of all time.for a list of important styles,see: abstract art movements.what were the origins of cubist art?after three decades of impressionist-inspired art, culminating in the fauvist colourist movement (of which, incidentally, braque had been a member), picasso began to worry that this type of painting was a dead-end with less and less potential for intellectual exploration. in this frame of mind, and recently exposed to african tribal art whilst in spain, he began painting les demoiselles d'avignon (1907, moma, new york), his ground-breaking masterpiece, whose flat splintered planes replaced traditional linear perspective and rounded volumes thereby signalling his break with the naturalistic traditions of western art. at the same time, georges braque, a former student at the prestigious ecole des beaux-arts in paris, had just been overwhelmed by the 1907 exhibition of cezanne's paintings at the parisian salon d'automne and the bernheim-jeune gallery - notably cezanne's masterpiece the large bathers (les grandes baigneuses) (1894-1905). the pair then met in october 1907, and over the next two years developed what became known as cubism - a completely new method of depicting the visual world.note: to see how non-naturalistic impressionist painting led to abstract art like cubism, see: realism to impressionism (1830-1900). to see why cubism is related to classicism, please see our article: the classical revival in modern art (c.1900-30).the origin of the term 'cubism'in the summer of 1908, while staying at l'estaque near marseilles, braque painted a series of landscapes which were shown later that year at a gallery in paris owned by the art dealer daniel-henri kahnweiler. when reviewing this exhibition, the famous art critic louis vauxcelles commented on braque's way of reducing everything - sights, figures and houses - to geometric outlines, to cubes. the following year, vauxcelles used the expression 'bizarreries cubiques' (cubic excentricities) - a phrase allegedly first used by henri matisse - and by 1911 the term "cubism" had entered the english language. the description is quite apt for the blocklike forms in some of braques early landscapes, and in a few similiar works by picasso painted at horta del ebro in spain, though not for their later cubist pictures in which the forms are broken down into facets rather than cubes. the term was taken up by two practising cubists, gleizes and metzinger in their influential 1912 book du cubisme. 	how to understand cubismfirst off, its very difficult to appreciate cubism without examining its paintings. a good start is to compare early cubist still-lifes with traditional still life from (say) the baroque or dutch realist schools. if nothing else, you will appreciate the radical nature of cubism compared to traditional western art. note also that cubism was not a single style of painting: analytical cubism is completely different from the later synthetic cubism. the former is all about structure - how the picture should depict the object being painted; the latter is exclusively concerned with the surface of the picture, and what may be incorporated within it. one final word of advice: don't be put off by its strangeness. cubism is symbolic, challenging and full of ideas, but it's not a terribly pretty form of visual art.what are the characteristics of cubism?ever since the renaissance, if not before, artists painted pictures from a single fixed viewpoint, as if they were taking a photograph. the illusion of background depth was created using standard conventions of linear perspective (eg. objects were shown smaller as they receded) and by painting figures and objects with rounded shaded surfaces to convey a 3-d effect. in addition, the scene or object was painted at a particular moment in time.in contrast, braque and picasso thought that the full significance of an object could only be captured by showing it from multiple points of view and at different times. so, they abandoned the idea of a single fixed viewpoint and instead used a multiplicity of viewpoints. the object was then reassembled out of fragments of these different views, rather like a complex jigsaw puzzle. in this way, many different views of an object were simultanously depicted in the same picture. in a sense, it's like taking 5 different photographs (at different times) of the same object, then cutting them up and reassembling them in an overlapping manner on a flat surface.such fragmentation and rearrangement of form meant that a painting could now be regarded less as a kind of window on the world and more as a physical object on which a subjective response to the world is created. as far as artistic technique was concerned, cubism showed how a sense of solidity and pictorial structure could be created without traditional perspective or modelling.thus the cubist style focused on the flat, two-dimensional surface of the picture plane, and rejected the traditional conventions and techniques of linear perspective, chiaroscuro (use of shading to show light and shadow) and the traditional idea of imitating nature. instead of creating natural-looking 3-d objects, cubist painters offered a brand new set of images reassembled from 2-d fragments which showed the objects from several sides simultaneously. if fauvists and impressionists strove to express their personal sensation of a particular object or scene, cubists sought to depict the intellectual idea or form of an object, and its relationship to others.note: for other important stylistic trends similar to cubism, please see art movements, periods, schools (from about 100 bce).cubist exhibitionscubism had two identities, a public and a private. the style was jointly evolved by pablo picasso and georges braque on the basis of observations derived from cezanne, and also, to some extent, from ethnographical primitivism such as that investigated by picasso during his african art period. it made its public debut with braque's one-man exhibition organized by kahnweiler in november 1908. but after this both he and picasso more or less went to ground, and the cubist banner was upheld by others - the so-called "salon-cubists - including robert delaunay, albert gleizes, fernand leger, henri le fauconnier, and jean metzinger at the salon des independeants in 1911.in 1912, a group of cubists calling themselves the section d'or, with delaunay at their head, exhibited at the galerie la boetie. when he reviewed this show, the art critic guillaume apollinaire (1880-1918) coined the term 'orphism', applying it to delaunay in particular. the first published statement of cubist theory was du cubisme, by metzinger and gleizes, published in 1912; this was followed by apollinaire's les peintres cubistes, published in 1913. the year 1913 also witnessed the famous armory show, held in feb/march on lexington avenue, manhattan, new york, in which marcel duchamp's nude descending a staircase (no 2) (1912) was the controversial, even scandalous, attraction. (the work was later bought by the philadelphia museum of art.)around the beginning of 1912, picasso and braque switched from the analytic cubism with which they started, to synthetic cubism - a new more decorative and surface-oriented style created using new techniques such as collage and papier colles. the incorporation of everyday detritus into their paintings can be seen as the beginning of junk art. at this point, they were joined in their explorations by juan gris.during world war i the forced departure of daniel-henry kahnweiler led to leonce rosenberg (1879-1947) becoming the major dealer for cubist painters in paris. his brother paul rosenberg (1881-1959) was picasso's main dealer during the interwar years.symbol of artistic & intellectual fashioncubism was an art-style with attitude! it was iconoclastic, challenging, intellectual. it focused on ideas rather than pretty pictures. but it captured the spirit of the age - the age of challenging french musicians claude debussy (1862-1918), erik satie (1866-1925) and maurice ravel (1875-1937), and analytical cubism in particular corresponded with the ideas of the french philosopher henri bergson (1859-1941), whose concept of simultaneity stated that the past overlaps with the present, which itself flows into the future. meanwhile, fine art was at something of a crossroads. impressionism was yesterday's fashion, the belle epoque of parisian poster art was over, toulouse-lautrec was dead, art nouveau was in decline, and even colourful fauvism was running out of steam. at the same time, the political temperature was rising across europe, exposing horrific possibilities of war and chaos. in its assault on the old certainties of renaissance art, cubism mirrored the calls for change in many other disciplines, as well as the world at large. note: for an explanation of some of the great cubist works by picasso and others, see: analysis of modern paintings (1800-2000). cubist sculpturecubist sculpture, like constructivism, was too radical to become an integral part of the artistic mainstream. even so, cubist ideas were also absorbed and adapted by those working in other disciplines such as abstract sculpture, as well as architecture and applied art. cubist sculpture developed from collage and papier colle, and fed into assemblage. the new techniques not only liberated sculptors to employ new subject matter, but also prompted them to think of sculptures as built, not just modelled, objects. the mathematical and architectural qualities found in gris's work were very influential here, as seen in the work of archipenko and ossip zadkine, raymond duchamp-villon and henri laurens, the lithuanian jacques lipchitz, the hungarian-born french sculptor joseph csaky (1888-1971), and the czech sculptors emil filla (1882-1953) and otto gutfreund (1889-1927).picasso (1881-1973)head of a woman (1909) moma, new york.guitar (1912) musee picasso, paris.raymond duchamp-villon (1876-1918)the large horse (1914) musee national d'art moderne, paris.henri laurens (1885-1954)head of a woman (1915) moma, new york.alexander archipenko (1887-1964)woman walking (1912) private collection.marching soldier (1917) private collection.naum gabo (1890-1977)head of a woman (1917-20) moma, ny.jacques lipchitz (1891-1973)man with guitar (1915) moma, ny.sailor with guitar (1915) musee national d'art moderne, paris.the bathers iii (1917) barnes foundation.cubist design in czechoslovakiacubist theories of design were taken up enthusiastically in czechoslovakia by artists, sculptors, designers and architects, who translated the characteristics of cubist painting (simplified geometric forms, contrasts of light and dark, prism-like facets, angular lines) into architecture and decorative art, including furniture, jewellery art, tableware, ceramics and landscaping. prominent were the members of the group of plastic artists, which was founded in 1911 by filla to focus on cubism. the group was active in prague until 1914 and included sculptors filla and gutfreund, as well as architects and designers pavel janak, josef gocar (1880-1945), josef chochol (1880-1956), vlastislav hofman (1884-1964) and otokar novotny. gutfreund published influential articles in the group's monthly journal.the house of the black madonna (1911-12), a department store designed by gocar, was the first piece of cubist architecture to be built. the grand cafe orient situated on the first floor, complete with a cubist interior and cubist light fixtures, rapidly became a meeting place for the avant-garde until its closure in the mid-1920s. the building is now part of the czech museum of fine arts and houses the czech cubism museum, which was opened in 1994, containing a permanent exhibition of cubist paintings, furniture, sculptures and porcelain. the czech cubism museum also contains an exhibition of collages by the czech artist and poet jiri kolar, who was also active in france. his ideas later introduced collage to a wider context. paris may have been the site of the birth of cubism, but it was in prague that its possibilities were explored most fully, as a whole way of life.legacyultimately cubism is less important in its own right - as an artistic style - and more important as an indicator of what is possible in fine art. it extended the boundaries of art to include alternatives to traditional single point perspective; it demonstrated that fine art could be made out of anything, even scraps of rubbish; and it raised important questions about the nature of reality in art. it was one of the most important movements associated with the ecole de paris, and made significant contributions to avant garde art in the early 20th century. in particular, cubism had a widespread and persistent influence on a wide variety of painting movements, including, most importantly, futurism (c.1909-14) - see for instance woman on the balcony (1912, private collection) by carlo carra (1881-1966). other movements and styles influenced by cubist motifs include: french orphism (c.1910-13), english vorticism (c.1913-19), russian rayonism (c.1912-15), and constructivism (c.1914-25), the dutch design group de stijl (1917-31) as well as american styles such as synchromism (c.1913-18) and precisionism (1920s). its anti-art elements stimulated the emergence of dada in 1916, and surrealism in 1924.greatest cubist paintingspablo picassohouses on the hill (1909) museum of modern art, new york.woman with a fan (1909) pushkin museum.portrait of ambroise vollard (1910), pushkin state museum of fine arts.girl with a mandolin (fanny tellier) (1910) museum of modern art, new york.still life with chair-caning (1911-12) picasso museum, paris.three musicians (1921) museum of modern art, new york.guernica (1937) reina sofia art museum, madrid.weeping woman (1937) tate collection, london.georges braquehouses at l'estaque (1908) kunstmuseum, bern.large nude (nu) (1908) musee national d'art moderne, pompidou centre.still life with herrings/fish (1909-11), moma, ny.the portuguese (1911) kunstmuseum, basel.fruit dish and glass (1912) private collection.juan gris (1887-1927)portrait of maurice raynal (1911) private collection.portrait of pablo picasso (1912) art institute of chicago.violin and guitar (1913) private collection.still life with fruit, bottle of water (1914) kroller-muller museum, otterlo.pack of coffee (1914) ulmer museum, ulm.fernand leger (1881-1955)nudes in the forest (1909-11) kroller-muller, otterlo.the wedding (1911) musee national d'art moderne, pompidou centre.soldiers playing at cards (1917) kroller-muller state museum, otterlo.marcel duchamp (1887-1968)nude descending a staircase (no 2) (1912) philadelphia museum of art.king and queen traversed by swift nudes at high speed (1912) philadelphia.robert delaunay (1885-1941)window (1912) morton g neumann collection, chicago.circular forms: sun and moon (1912) kunstmuseum, zurich.francis picabia (1879-1953)udnie, young american girl (1913) musee national d'art moderne.albert gleizes (1881-1953)portrait of jacques nayral (1911) tate modern, london.woman with animals (1914) peggy guggenheim collection, venice.jean metzinger (1883-1956)tea time (woman with teaspoon) (1911) philadelphia museum of art.dancer in a cafe (1912) albright-knox art gallery, buffalo.lyonel feininger (1871-1956)franciscan church (1924) staatsgalerie, stuttgart, germany.roger de la fresnaye (1885-1925)l’artillerie (1911, metropolitan museum of art, new york city).all about cubismdiscover the radical 20th century art movement. this resource introduces cubist artists, ideas and techniques and provides discussion and activities.what is cubism and why was it so radical?in around 1907 two artists living in paris called pablo picasso and georges braque developed a revolutionary new style of painting which transformed everyday objects, landscapes, and people into geometric shapes. in 1908 art critic louis vauxcelles, saw some landscape paintings by georges braque (similar to the picture shown above) in an exhibition in paris, and described them as ‘bizarreries cubiques’ which translates as ‘cubist oddities’ – and the term cubism was coined.by comparing a cubist still life with an earlier still life painted using a more traditional approach, we can see immediately just what it is that made cubism look so radically different from earlier painting styles. both paintings are of musical instruments. the first is by edward collier and was painted in the seventeenth century. the second is by cubist georges braque. compare the way the instruments are painted in the paintings. which look the most real? how has collier made the objects in his painting look realistic? (look at how he has used shading or tone, colour, perspective and also how he has applied the paint). what rules do you think the cubists broke?his use of colour to help us recognise the objects. a golden brown colour suggests the wood of the stringed instruments and table; the book and sheet music are black (ink) and white (paper); the grapes are a lush dark purple; and he has even cleverly recreated the metallic surface of the two-handled bowl using dark greys and whiteshis use of light and dark tones (shadows and highlights) to suggest the three-dimensional quality of the objects. look at the side of the stringed instrument at the front of the painting. light reflects off the raised surface closest to us, but as this curves away from us, the tone used is darker to suggest that it is more in shadow.the background is a shadowy dark space behind the tablehis use of perspective to create the impression of a real space with objects in the foreground looking bigger and clearer and objects behind looking smaller and less clear.although the shape of the mandora (a stringed instrument similar to a lute) is fairly clear, and if we look closely we can make out a bottle behind it, there is very little difference between the way braque has painted the objects and the space around them. he has fragmented the whole image into tiny flat geometric shapes so the edges of the objects are less clearhe has not used realistic colours for the different objects in the painting, instead he has used the same small range of muted colours – black, greys, ochres and earthy greens – for all the objects (no matter what they are) and the backgroundhe has not used perspective, or tone (light and shadow) to create the illusion of three-dimensional space or three-dimensional objects. although there are lighter and darker tones within the painting, and these do sometimes create the appearance of three-dimensions (a dark tone is used for the side of the mandora making it look like a solid object); the tone is not always used in this way and sometimes seems confusing. the mandora, the objects behind it, and the background all seem to sit on the same level – on the flat surface of the picture, with no foreground or background, and no illusion of receding space.in 1907 georges braque visited pablo picasso’s studio. this studio visit marked the beginning of one of the most important friendships in the history of art. over the next few months and years the two artists shared their ideas, scrutinized each other’s work, challenged and encouraged each other. at some stage in around 1907 or 1908 they invented an exciting new style of painting – cubism. their close working relationship at that time was later described by georges braque:the things that picasso and i said to one another during those years will never be said again, and even if they were, no one would understand them anymore. it was like being roped together on a mountainpicasso and braque were soon joined in their art adventure by other artists who were experimenting with different ways of depicting the world around them. artists such as juan gris, albert gleizes, jean metzinger and robert delaunay who all worked in a cubist style.cubism looks very different to lots of other styles of painting. how does it work? what were braque and picasso's reasons for turning their back on traditional techniques? how did the cubists develop their new style?the illusion of spacesince the renaissance in the fifteenth century, european artists had aimed to create the illusion of three-dimensional space in their drawings and paintings. they wanted the experience of looking at a painting to be like looking through a window onto a real landscape, interior, person or object.how do you make things look three-dimensional on a two-dimensional surface? techniques such as linear perspective and tonal gradation are used. perspective involves making things look bigger and clearer when they are close up, and smaller and less clear when they are further away. by doing this you can create the illusion of space. artists also use tones (shadows) to create the illusion of three-dimensional objects. by gradually changing the darkness of a shadow, you can make something look solid.these drawings by j.m.w turner show how perspective and tone (or shadow) can be used to create the illusion of real, solid three-dimensional objects.a new realitythe cubists however, felt that this type of illusion is trickery and does not give a real experience of the object.their aim was to show things as they really are, not just to show what they look like. they felt that they could give the viewer a more accurate understanding of an object, landscape or person by showing it from different angles or viewpoints, so they used flat geometric shapes to represent the different sides and angles of the objects. by doing this, they could suggest three-dimensional qualities and structure without using techniques such as perspective and shading.this breaking down of the real world into flat geometric shapes also emphasized the two-dimensional flatness of the canvas. this suited the cubists’ belief that a painting should not pretend to be like a window onto a realistic scene but as a flat surface it should behave like one.look at this painting by georges braque of a glass on a table. can you spot the techniques he has used to emphasize the flatness of the picture, but at the same time, made the objects look solid?the phases of cubism: analytical vs syntheticcubism can be split into two distinct phases. the first phase, analytical cubism, is considered to have run until around 1912. it looks more austere or serious. objects are split into lots of flat shapes representing the views of them from different angles, and muted colours and darker tones or shades are used. the second phase, synthetic cubism, involves simpler shapes and brighter colours (and looks more light-hearted and fun!)cubismcubism was a revolutionary new approach to representing reality invented in around 1907–08 by artists pablo picasso and georges braque. they brought different views of subjects (usually objects or figures) together in the same picture, resulting in paintings that appear fragmented and abstractedcubism was one of the most influential styles of the twentieth century. it is generally agreed to have begun around 1907 with picasso’s celebrated painting demoiselles d’avignon which included elements of cubist style. the name ‘cubism’ seems to have derived from a comment made by the critic louis vauxcelles who, on seeing some of georges braque’s paintings exhibited in paris in 1908, described them as reducing everything to ‘geometric outlines, to cubes’.cubism opened up almost infinite new possibilities for the treatment of visual reality in art and was the starting point for many later abstract styles including constructivism and neo-plasticism.by breaking objects and figures down into distinct areas – or planes – the artists aimed to show different viewpoints at the same time and within the same space and so suggest their three dimensional form. in doing so they also emphasized the two-dimensional flatness of the canvas instead of creating the illusion of depth. this marked a revolutionary break with the european tradition of creating the illusion of real space from a fixed viewpoint using devices such as linear perspective, which had dominated representation from the renaissanceonwards.what inspired cubist style?cubism was partly influenced by the late work of artist paul cézanne in which he can be seen to be painting things from slightly different points of view. pablo picasso was also inspired by african tribal masks which are highly stylised, or non-naturalistic, but nevertheless present a vivid human image. ‘a head’, said picasso, ‘is a matter of eyes, nose, mouth, which can be distributed in any way you like’.types of cubism: analytical vs. syntheticcubism can be seen to have developed in two distinct phases: the initial and more austere analytical cubism, and a later phase of cubism known as synthetic cubism.analytical cubism ran from 1908–12. its artworks look more severe and are made up of an interweaving of planes and lines in muted tones of blacks, greys and ochres.synthetic cubism is the later phase of cubism, generally considered to date from about 1912 to 1914, and characterised by simpler shapes and brighter colours. synthetic cubist works also often include collaged real elements such as newspapers. the inclusion of real objects directly in art was the start of one of the most important ideas in modern art.
